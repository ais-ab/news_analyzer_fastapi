Here's how it works. Michael Drummond Foreign news reporter @MikeRDrummond Wednesday 25 June 2025 12:34, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:00 Why is Article 5 so important? Why you can trust Sky News President Donald Trump's visit to the NATO summit on Wednesday is being closely watched for one big reason: will he commit America to Article 5? The principle of collective defence - enshrined in Article 5 of the alliance's founding treaty - goes to the heart of what NATO is set up to do. Under Article 5, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. But it's not quite that simple. What is Article 5? Article 5 is the core principle of the 32-member North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. It says that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members. It further states that if such an armed attack happens, each other member would take \"such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area\". Article 5 covers the territory of member states in Europe and North America as well as Turkey . It doesn't cover bases in foreign countries or territories outside the alliance area - for instance, it didn't apply to the Vietnam War, the Falklands or to the recent Iranian attack on a US base in Qatar . Image: NATO's Article 5 has been at the heart of European security for decades. Pic: AP How does Article 5 work? This is where it gets a bit more complicated. When Article 5 is invoked by a NATO member, allies can provide any form of assistance they deem necessary to respond to a situation. It doesn't automatically mean military assistance and it's up to each individual ally to decide what action they think is necessary. That assistance is then taken forward in conjunction with the rest of the alliance. This was a tension between Europe and the US at the founding of NATO - the US did not want to sign itself up to automatically provide assistance - and it's very similar to what we are seeing with President Trump now . Read more: Trump dodges commitment to founding NATO principle Image: Donald Trump with NATO secretary general Mark Rutte at the NATO summit in the Netherlands. Pic: Reuters Has Article 5 ever been invoked? Yes, once. After the September 11 attacks, NATO allies triggered Article 5 and came to America's assistance. This culminated in the NATO-led invasion of Afghanistan due to accusations that the ruling Taliban had provided safe haven to al Qaeda. NATO allies fought side-by-side with the US and in some of the fiercest parts of the campaign.

It's why JD Vance's remarks about \"some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\" were viewed as particularly insulting in Europe. NATO allies have also acted to bolster collective defence measures on other occasions, beneath the threshold of Article 5, for example following Russia's annexation of Crimea and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Image: Map of US military bases in the Middle East An air-traffic control recording from the US suggests F-22 Raptors are being sent across the Atlantic. Two refuelling tankers are visible on flight tracking data leaving the US east coast, likely escorting the stealth fighter jets. In images taken by photographer Glenn Lockett in Suffolk, three US air tankers were seen flying over England, each accompanied by four F-35 jets.

Most of the US military planes tracked by Sky News regularly turn off their locations and final destinations, according to the data from Flightradar24. Some of the planes moved from the US to Europe, while others appeared to move closer to the Middle East. At least five of the US military aircraft landed at Chania Airport on the Greek island of Crete. Follow The World Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim every Wednesday Tap to follow US insists deployments are defensive US defence secretary Pete Hegseth stressed that the deployment of more aircraft was defensive in nature, as Washington looks to safeguard its forces in the region. Fighter aircraft have been used to shoot down drones and projectiles in the past. America already has a substantial force in the Middle East, with nearly 40,000 troops as well as air defence systems, aircraft and warships. But as the conflict between Israel and Iran carries on - and President Trump continues to make threats against Tehran - it's possible that multiple options could be on the table for intervention. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free B-2 bombers - the ones to watch? Asked what he's looking out for as speculation about whether the US will intervene directly continues, Prof Clarke pointed to one particular aircraft that hasn't been seen moving towards the region yet: The B-2 stealth bomber. Known for its iconic triangle shape and ability to penetrate deep air defences undetected, the B-2 has lesser-known capability that could be crucial for any action over Iran: it can carry 'bunker buster' bombs. So far Israel has not been able to damage Iran's secretive Fordow uranium enrichment plant, which is buried deep beneath a mountain. Image: A B-2 stealth bomber flies over Washington DC during a 4 July celebration. File pic: AP The only bomb believed to be powerful enough to penetrate the facility is America's GBU-57 , a 14-ton bomb that is so heavy it can only be launched from the US fleet of heavy bomber aircraft. Any movement of B-2 bombers to the joint UK-US base on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean could \"indicate the likelihood that the Americans are going to use bunker busters in Iran,\" Prof Clarke says.

Middle East latest: Trump rejects US intel on nuclear sites Leaders pledged to increase their annual defence spending to a total of 5% of GDP at the summit on Wednesday, fulfilling a long-standing demand by Mr Trump. \"Today we will decide to go to 5%,\" Mr Rutte said. \"We have to keep ourselves safe from our adversaries, but also because it's fair to equalise with the United States.\" Addressing the US president directly, the NATO secretary general added: \"This would not have happened if you would not have been elected in 2016 and re-elected last year... so I want to thank you.\" Mr Trump described the move as a \"great victory for everybody\", saying \"NATO is going to become very strong with us\". \"We're with them all the way\", he added. Image: Pic: Reuters Earlier, Mr Rutte had described the US president as \"a man of strength\" as well as a \"man of peace\", praising him for securing a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Mr Trump also compared Israel and Iran to \"two kids in a school yard\" fighting. \"They fight like hell. You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two, three minutes. Then it's easier to stop them,\" he said. Mr Rutte added: \"Then daddy has to sometimes use strong language.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:00 US strike on Iran 'ended the war' 'That hit ended the war' Tensions between Israel and Iran hung over the summit on Wednesday amid a fragile ceasefire. Several news outlets have published stories that intelligence reports in the US suggest that the American attack on Iran's nuclear programme over the weekend has only set it back by a few months , rather than \"obliterated\" it as Mr Trump has suggested. Mr Trump said the strikes were an \"obliteration\" but acknowledged the intelligence was \"very inconclusive\". \"The intelligence says we don't know,\" he added. \"It could've been very severe. That's what the intelligence suggests. \"It was very severe. There was obliteration.\" Mr Trump added: \"That hit ended the war\". Drawing comparisons to US atomic bombings during the Second World War, he said: \"I don't want to use an example of Hiroshima. I don't want to use an example of Nagasaki. But that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war.\" Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the administration was launching an investigation into the disclosure of those intelligence findings. 'Ironclad commitment' to collective defence Alongside their pledge to increase defence spending, NATO leaders affirmed their \"ironclad commitment\" to collective defence. Mr Trump had sparked concern on Tuesday after saying he cast doubt on his commitment to the alliance's mutual defence guarantees. Mr Trump avoided directly endorsing Article 5 , telling reporters en route to the summit that there were \"numerous definitions\" of the clause. NATO's Article 5 requires members to defend each other from attack. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:00 Why is NATO's Article 5 so important? Mr Trump said on Air Force One: \"I'm committed to saving lives. I'm committed to life and safety. And I'm going to give you an exact definition when I get there.\" Asked about the comments, Mr Rutte insisted Mr Trump was \"totally committed\" to Article 5. \"For me, there is absolute clarity that the United States is totally committed to NATO, totally committed to Article 5,\" Mr Rutte said. --> Spotify This content is provided by Spotify , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Mr Rutte earlier acknowledged it was not easy for countries to fund the hike in defence spending, but said it was vital to do so in light of European fears that Russia poses an increasing threat to their security following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \"There is absolute conviction with my colleagues at the table that given this threat from the Russians, given the international security situation, there is no alternative,\" he told reporters.

Ed Conway Economics and data editor @EdConwaySky Tuesday 24 June 2025 19:31, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:08 Are UK goods going to Russia? Why you can trust Sky News For more than a year, we have been tracking the flow of sanctioned items out of the UK and towards Russia. Electronic equipment, radar parts, components used to make aircraft and drones. These are all items that have been banned from going to Russia . For good reason: while Britain is far from a global manufacturing powerhouse, it nonetheless still makes certain prized components used to make machinery. In some hands, these components could be used for peaceful purposes, but they could also be used to wage war. All of which is why they are among the items sanctioned by G7 nations and banned from entry to Russia. A glance at the trade figures might lull you into thinking those sanctions have been extraordinarily successful. Look at the flows of these so-called \"dual use\" goods from the UK to Russia and they drop to zero shortly after the invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of those export bans. But that's not the whole story - because over precisely the same period, exports of those same items to countries neighbouring Russia have risen sharply. At this point, the data trail goes cold. As far as the statistics tell us, those components stay in the Caucasus and Central Asia. But there are two powerful pieces of evidence that suggest otherwise. The first is that we have travelled out to the border of Russia and filmed European-sanctioned goods (in this case cars, the hardest of all goods to disguise) passing across the border. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:20 Zelenskyy: Sanctions needed as countries supplying missile components to Russia The second is that Ukrainian forces have repeatedly found weaponry and equipment containing European and British components inside them on the battlefield in their country. British technology has been used to kill Ukrainians - in spite of sanctions. That was one of the messages President Volodymyr Zelenskyy relayed in his interview with my colleague Mark Austin. So, in the wake of that interview, we revisited the databases to see if those flows of goods to Russian neighbours had slowed in recent months. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free But, far from slowing, they've accelerated. In the past nine months, the flow of dual-use goods to Russian neighbours has risen by an average of 9%, compared with the monthly average between the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and last June. Those flows are 111% higher than they were before the invasion. Read more: Analysis: Reasons for rhetoric from Russia Western brands remain on Russian shelves Putin says 'Ukraine is ours' Nor are the flows of British goods to Russian neighbours the only trend suggesting these components are being trans-shipped via third countries. Look at exports of sanctioned items to the United Arab Emirates and Turkey and they are up by a similar proportion. In short: the evasion of sanctions continues much as it has done since the beginning of the war. For all the talk about the toughest sanctions regime in history, the reality on the ground is somewhat different.

Stable ceasefires usually require a lot of preparation so that everyone on both sides knows what is supposed to happen, and - more importantly - when. And they normally agree on how it will be monitored so one side cannot seize a quick advantage by breaking it suddenly.

Pic: Majid Asgaripour/WANA via Reuters Without such preparations, and sometimes even with them, ceasefires will tend to be breached - perhaps by accident, perhaps because one side does not exercise full control over its own forces, perhaps as a result of false alarms, or even because a third party - a guerrilla group or a militia, say - choose that moment to launch an attack of their own. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:23 Timeline of Israel-Iran conflict so far The important question is whether a ceasefire breach is just random and unfortunate, or else deliberate and systemic - where someone is actively trying to break it. Either way, ceasefires have to be politically reinforced all the time if they are to hold.

Follow The World Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim every Wednesday Tap to follow Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free If enemies like Israel and Iran naturally distrust each other and need little incentive to \"hit back\" in some way at every provocation, it will take US pressure to make them abide by a ceasefire that may be breaking down.

The clause asserts the principle of collective and mutual defence, meaning an attack against one NATO ally is considered an attack against all members. It came as the US president spoke to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NATO summit in The Hague, the Netherlands, and was asked about his commitment to Article 5. He replied that it \"depends on your definition\" of it, while adding that he was \"committed to being their friend\". Image: Donald Trump speaks to reporters onboard Air Force One.

I just don't want to do it on the back of an airplane.\" The NATO summit is intended to signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the alliance is united and set on expanding and upgrading its defences to deter any attack on its members from Moscow.

NATO 'at risk of attack' Mr Zelenskyy said plans for NATO members to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 are \"very slow\" and warned Russia could attack a NATO country within five years to test the alliance. \"We believe that, starting from 2030, Putin can have significantly greater capabilities,\" he said. \"Today, Ukraine is holding him up, he has no time to drill the army.\" But while Mr Zelenskyy conceded his ambition to join NATO \"isn't possible now\", he asserted long term \"NATO needs Ukrainians\".

On Donald Trump's Truth Social site, it came in two parts. Part one read: \"CONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT'S TIME FOR PEACE.\" The Magna Carta it wasn't, but it was a peace treaty for our times - a US president announcing there would be no retaliation against Iran's missile attack. An anxious world watching for US bombers returning to Iranian skies could cool its jets - and the primetime president could feel vindicated, having enjoyed strategic success. Image: Donald Trump at a meeting in the Situation Room at the White House. Pic: Reuters Trump has tweaked the politics and military landscape around Iran to suit US interests, without a single American life lost. He had framed US intervention in Iran as an effort to prevent a \"forever\" foreign war, not to provoke it, and he is sitting pretty, following ugly predictions he'd be sucked into conflict.

Related Topics: Iran Israel Image: Footage appeared to show a residential building in southern Israel that was extensively damaged. Pic: AP Then, on Truth Social, there was peace \"part two\". A couple of hours after announcing non-retaliation, Trump wrote the sequel: \"Ceasefire.\" He posted: \"CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE!\" - saying a \"complete and total\" ceasefire had been fully agreed between Israel and Iran. Quite the day of problem-solving for the self-styled \"peacemaker-in-chief\". Quite the day of problems unsolved too - time will tell. As deadlines loomed, neither Israel nor Iran appeared fully committed to the Trump script, and fresh missiles were fired overnight. Daytime will test the durability of a ceasefire. There are motivations on both sides to continue a conflict in which both see the other as an existential threat.

Can Israel be convinced to pull back on its military advantage when its instinct will be to reinforce superiority and undermine an Iranian rebuild? Trump's influence will be tested, as ever, when he flies to a NATO summit in The Netherlands today. For him, it can be a difficult crowd and one for whom he remains a mystery. A positive result in the Middle East will help to confound their curiosity, for the better. It's the most important day for Donald Trump since the last one.

The billionaire will marry Lauren Sanchez in the Italian city this week, and the couple will mark the occasion with three days of celebrations costing up to â‚¬48m (Â£41m). The venue where the couple will say their vows has been kept secret, but their wedding party has at the last minute been moved out of the city centre, Reuters news agency reports.

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding in numbers â‚¬48m price tag The wedding and its parts are expected to cost an eye-watering â‚¬40-48m (Â£34-Â£41m), Luca Zaia, the president of Venice's local government, said on Tuesday. This includes sizeable charity donations from the Amazon founder, including â‚¬1m (Â£850k) to Corila, a consortium that studies Venice's lagoon ecosystem, local media has reported. 90 private jets The first private jets began landing at Venice airport on Tuesday and there will be around 90 in total, Mr Zaia said. They won't all be arriving in Venice though, as some will land at the nearby Treviso and Verona airports. 250 guests Five of the city's most luxurious hotels have been booked out to host an estimated 200-250 guests. These include the celeb favourite Cipriani, where George and Amal Clooney married in 2014. 30 water taxis Attendees of course won't be hopping on public water buses to get around the city's many islands. The wedding's organisers have booked at least 30 water taxis for them to use instead. Amid the last-minute changes, guests, including Donald Trump's daughter, have begun arriving in Italy. Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were seen boarding a water taxi at Venice airport on Tuesday, as was fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg.

But now its leadership is switching to crisis mode amid fears about the future of the alliance.

Why you can trust Sky News Russia is getting nervous about Donald Trump's trigger finger, and it shows. Comments from deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov â€“ warning the US against joining Israel's military campaign â€“ betray Moscow's growing unease that it could be about to lose its closest Middle Eastern ally. Russia has strong ties with Iran , which have deepened since the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. These were formalised in a strategic partnership pact the two countries signed at the start of the year. Israel-Iran conflict - live updates So, at first, Russia seemed to view its ally's conflict with Israel as an opportunity to gain leverage. The Kremlin was quick to offer its services as a potential mediator. If Vladimir Putin could persuade Tehran to back down and return to nuclear talks with Washington, he'd potentially have a favour to cash in with the White House over its military support for Ukraine. But the offers to mediate fell on deaf ears. And with Mr Trump threatening to assassinate Iran's supreme leader, Moscow has switched to crisis mode â€“ fearful of losing its second key regional ally in six months, after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria. So, as well as Ryabkov, other senior figures have taken to the airwaves. Russia's spy chief Sergei Naryshkin called the situation \"critical\".

Follow The World Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim every Wednesday It's quite the spectacle â€“ a country that's been waging war on its neighbour for more than three years is now urging others to show military restraint. That's because US involvement poses serious consequences, not just for Iran, but for Russia too. But none here would be drawn on what Moscow would do if Trump does bomb Tehran. The notoriously outspoken Ms Zakharova was unusually tight-lipped on that particular question when I caught up with her at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. She wasn't even able to say whether it would constitute an escalation, when the whole world can see that it would. That's because Russian officials are in an unfamiliar position - caught between a long-time ally and the country whose affections they're courting. Hence the reluctance to directly criticise Trump. I think they're also waiting to see what Russia's president will say, when he addresses news agencies later on Wednesday evening. So far, in public at least, he's remained silent.

In an operation that has been in the planning for years, American B-2 stealth bombers dropped enormous bunker-busting bombs - the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator - on the Fordow nuclear fuel enrichment plant , around 70 miles (110km) southwest of Tehran. It was built under a mountain - about 80 to 90 metres beneath the ground - to be beyond the reach of Israel's armed forces. Only the US Air Force carries munitions large enough to penetrate the rock, earth and concrete to inflict meaningful damage. Image: Satellite imagery shows the Fordow nuclear site after US strikes. Pic: Maxar Also targeted with the enormous munitions was Iran's main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, 155 miles (250km) southeast of the Iranian capital. In addition, US submarines launched TLAM cruise missiles against a site outside the city of Isfahan, which is 260 miles (420km) south of Tehran. Near-bomb-grade nuclear fuel is thought to be stored here. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:41 Inside a top secret nuclear weapons site The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog, however, said the six buildings at Isfahan that were hit contained little or no nuclear material. Mr Trump has said he ordered the attack to destroy Iran's ability to enrich uranium to a level that could be used to make a nuclear bomb. Tehran has always insisted its nuclear programme is purely for civilian purposes. Analysts warn, though, that it would be very difficult to stop the Iranian nuclear programme through military action alone and that such a move may spur Iran to accelerate efforts to make a bomb if it has managed to protect key components. Follow the World Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim every Wednesday Tap to follow The Russian foreign ministry on Sunday strongly condemned the American strikes against Iranian nuclear sites as a \"dangerous escalation\" that could further undermine \"regional and global security\". \"The risk of an escalation of conflict in the Middle East already beset by multiple crises, has increased significantly,\" it said in a statement. Last week, the Russian government warned the US against joining Israel's war in Iran, saying this \"would be an extremely dangerous step with truly unpredictable negative consequences\". The remarks came after Mr Putin held a call with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping . It means the Russian government in particular - given Tehran's military support to Moscow in the Russian invasion of Ukraine - faces an urgent decision about how to support Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, whose very existence is under threat from Israel.

Forbes McKenzie, founder of McKenzie Intelligence, says that this indicates \"the build-up of warfighting capability, which was not [in the region] before\". Sky's data does not include fighter jets, which typically fly without publicly revealing their location. An air traffic control recording from Wednesday suggests that F-22 Raptors are among the planes being sent across the Atlantic, while 12 F-35 fighter jets were photographed travelling from the UK to the Middle East on Wednesday. Image: A US air tanker seen flying over Suffolk, accompanied by F-35 jets. Pic: Instagram/g.lockaviation Many US military planes are passing through UK A growing number of US Air Force planes have been passing through the UK in recent days. Analysis of flight tracking data at three key air bases in the UK shows 63 US military flights landing between 16 and 19 June - more than double the rate of arrivals earlier in June. On Thursday, Sky News filmed three US military C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft and a C-130 Hercules military cargo plane arriving at Glasgow's Prestwick Airport. Flight tracking data shows that one of the planes arrived from an air base in Jordan, having earlier travelled there from Germany. What does Israel need from US? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on 15 March that his country's aim is to remove \"two existential threats - the nuclear threat and the ballistic missile threat\". Israel says that Iran is attempting to develop a nuclear bomb, though Iran says its nuclear facilities are only for civilian energy purposes. A US intelligence assessment in March concluded that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. President Trump dismissed the assessment on Tuesday, saying: \"I think they were very close to having one.\" Forbes McKenzie says the Americans have a \"very similar inventory of weapons systems\" to the Israelis, \"but of course, they also have the much-talked-about GBU-57\". Image: A GBU-57, or the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, at Whiteman Air Base in Missouri in 2023. File pic: US Air Force via AP The GBU-57 is a 30,000lb bomb - the largest non-nuclear bomb in existence. Mr McKenzie explains that it is \"specifically designed to destroy targets which are very deep underground\". Experts say it is the only weapon with any chance of destroying Iran's main enrichment site, which is located underneath a mountain at Fordow. Image: Map showing the Fordow enrichment plant Air-to-air refuelling could allow Israel to carry larger bombs Among the dozens of US aircraft that Sky News tracked over the eastern Mediterranean in recent days, more than a third (18 planes) were designed for air-to-air refuelling. \"These are crucial because Israel is the best part of a thousand miles away from Iran,\" says Sky News military analyst Sean Bell. \"Most military fighter jets would struggle to do those 2,000-mile round trips and have enough combat fuel.\" The ability to refuel mid-flight would also allow Israeli planes to carry heavier munitions, including bunker-buster bombs necessary to destroy the tunnels and silos where Iran stores many of its missiles. Satellite imagery captured on 15 June shows the aftermath of Israeli strikes on a missile facility near the western city of Kermanshah, which destroyed at least 12 buildings at the site. Image: Seven of the 12 destroyed buildings at Kermanshah missile facility, Iran, 15 June 2025. Pic: Maxar At least four tunnel entrances were also damaged in the strikes, two of which can be seen in the image below. Image: Damaged tunnel entrances at Kermanshah missile facility, Iran, 15 June 2025. Pic: Maxar Writing for Jane's Defence Weekly, military analyst Jeremy Binnie says it looked like the tunnels were \"targeted using guided munitions coming in at angles, not destroyed from above using penetrator bombs, raising the possibility that the damage can be cleared, enabling any [missile launchers] trapped inside to deploy\". \"This might reflect the limited payloads that Israeli aircraft can carry to Iran,\" he adds. Penetrator bombs, also known as bunker-busters, are much heavier than other types of munitions and as a result require more fuel to transport. Israel does not have the latest generation of refuelling aircraft, Mr Binnie says, meaning it is likely to struggle to deploy a significant number of penetrator bombs. Israel has struck most of Iran's western missile bases Even without direct US assistance, the Israeli air force has managed to inflict significant damage on Iran's missile launch capacity. Sky News has confirmed Israeli strikes on at least five of Iran's six known missile bases in the west of the country. --> Datawrapper This content is provided by Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Among Iran's most advanced weapons are three types of solid-fuelled rockets fitted with highly manoeuvrable warheads: Fattah-1, Kheibar Shekan and Haj Qassam. The use of solid fuel makes these missiles easy to transport and fast to launch, while their manoeuvrable warheads make them better at evading Israeli air defences.

Iran's missiles have caused significant damage Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 24 people in Israel and wounded hundreds, according to the Israeli foreign ministry. The number of air raid alerts in Israel has topped 1,000 every day since the start of hostilities, reaching a peak of 3,024 on 15 June. Iran has managed to strike some government buildings, including one in the city of Haifa on Friday. And on 13 June, in Iran's most notable targeting success so far, an Iranian missile impacted on or near the headquarters of Israel's defence ministry in Tel Aviv. Most of the Iranian strikes verified by Sky News, however, have hit civilian targets. These include residential buildings, a school and a university. --> Datawrapper This content is provided by Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Israel has killed much of Iran's military leadership It's not clear exactly how many people Israel's strikes in Iran have killed, or how many are civilians. Estimates by human rights groups of the total number of fatalities exceed 600. What is clear is that among the military personnel killed are many key figures in the Iranian armed forces, including the military's chief of staff, deputy head of intelligence and deputy head of operations. Key figures in the powerful Revolutionary Guard have also been killed, including the militia's commander-in-chief, its aerospace force commander and its air defences commander. On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that US assistance was not necessary for Israel to win the war. \"We will achieve all our objectives and hit all of their nuclear facilities,\" he said. \"We have the capability to do that.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:49 How close is Iran to producing a nuclear weapon?

US President Donald Trump promised the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity - Sky News' Data and Forensics team assesses how much America's airstrikes achieved. By Freya Gibson, Kaitlin Tosh and Sophia Massam, data and forensics team Tuesday 24 June 2025 03:40, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:58 Iran's nuclear capabilities Why you can trust Sky News Three of Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities - Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan - were targeted in US airstrikes on 22 June. The prime target of the attacks was Iran's most advanced facility at Fordow, suspected of being used to enrich uranium close to what's needed for a nuclear bomb. Satellite images from the aftermath of the US strikes suggest at least six bombs were dropped there. Image: Satellite imagery of Fordow after the US bombing. Pic: Maxar Technologies The secure nuclear facility, home to Iran's main enrichment site, is buried deep under a mountain. So exactly how much damage was done is unknown, perhaps even to Iran, which appears to have evacuated the site. The specific location of the strikes and the bombs used gives us an indication. America used the 30,000-lb Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, or a GBU-57 - commonly known as a \"bunker buster\". The bunker buster is the only missile that had a chance of destroying the Fordow facility, and American planes were needed for them to be used.

Image: Blueprints of the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant suggest tunnels run through the mountain. Pic: Google Earth The access tunnels overground lead to a 250 metre long hall which is thought to contain the uranium enrichment centrifuges, and well as the location of what is thought to be ventilation shafts. Iran is thought to have likely moved any enriched uranium from the facility before the strikes occurred. But if the ventilation shafts were hit, that would allow the bombs to penetrate as far as possible and hit the centrifuge hall itself. Iran's major nuclear facilities seriously damaged, if not completely destroyed Tom Clarke Science and technology editor @t0mclark3 The loss of industrial-scale centrifuge \"cascades\" used to enrich uranium will certainly derail any imminent deadlines in weaponisation the Islamic Republic may have set itself - more on that below. But it has already amassed a sizeable stockpile of highly enriched uranium and may even have already enriched some of it to the 90% or so needed to make fissile material necessary for a bomb. And despite strikes on industrial scale facilities that have taken decades to generate that stockpile, the material itself weighs less than half a tonne. Moving it, splitting it up, concealing it, is not beyond the wit of a nation that expected these assaults may be coming. Iran's nuclear programme is also more than its large-scale facilities. Iran has been developing nuclear expertise and industrial processes for decades. It would take more than a concerted bombing campaign to wipe that out. The final steps to \"weaponise\" highly enriched uranium are technically challenging, but Iran was known to be working on them more than 20 years ago. Iran also does not require industrial-scale facilities like those needed to enrich uranium, meaning they could be more easily concealed in a network of smaller, discrete lab-sized buildings. But what's far from clear is whether Iran had actually taken steps towards weaponisation in recent years. Recent US intelligence assessments indicated that it hadn't. Iran's leaders knew that very significant moves towards making a bomb would be seen as a major escalation by its neighbours and the international community. For a long time, a key deterrent to Iran developing a nuclear weapon has been an internal political one. It's possible of course that position may have been shifting and these latest strikes were designed to disarm a rapidly weaponising Iran. But it's also possible the attacks on its nuclear programme may be forcing a previously tentative government to push harder towards making a nuclear bomb. Fordow is only one of three nuclear facilities targeted in America's strike, however, and one of seven that have been targeted since the conflict began. Natanz's uranium enrichment facility, about 140 km south of Fordow, had been subject to multiple Israeli strikes before America's advance. --> Datawrapper This content is provided by Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Deborah Haynes Security and Defence Editor @haynesdeborah Wednesday 25 June 2025 13:09, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:00 Why is NATO's Article 5 so important? Why you can trust Sky News Donald Trump and his NATO allies confirmed their \"ironclad commitment\" to collective defence in a communique released at the end of a brief summit in The Hague. But there was no condemnation of Russia's war in Ukraine - something that had been in previous statements by allied leaders when Joe Biden was in the White House. His successor has a closer relationship with Vladimir Putin than many of his allies. The document did describe Russia as a \"long-term threat\". But there was also no word about NATO membership for Ukraine - something that had previously been described an \"irreversible path\". The allies also agreed to spend more on their collective defence. Middle East latest: Trump rejects US intel on nuclear sites The endorsement of Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty came after the US commander-in-chief - the most powerful leader in the room - suggested on his way to the gathering that his definition of what it means may differ from other allies. The US president's words risked undermining the credibility of a commitment that has helped ensure the security of NATO for more than 75 years, though the joint statement, approved by the leaders of all 32 member states spelt out clearly what Article 5 constitutes. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:53 NATO leaders pose for family photo \"We reaffirm our ironclad commitment to collective defence as enshrined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty - that an attack on one is an attack on all,\" it said. \"We remain united and steadfast in our resolve to protect our one billion citizens, defend the Alliance, and safeguard our freedom and democracy.\" Sir Keir Starmer and the leaders of all European member states, as well as Canada, are all too aware of Mr Trump's scepticism about NATO. He has accused his allies of taking advantage of the US's far more powerful armed forces to defend Europe and wants the rest of the alliance to take on more of the burden. Read more: How NATO's Article 5 clause works UK to buy nuclear-carrying fighter jets Doubt cast over success of 'Operation Midnight Hammer' Urgently needing to keep him onside, Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, has been rallying member states to agree to a new pledge to spend 5% of GDP on defence and related areas - a level first touted by Mr Trump. The statement commits allies to hit this goal by 2035, though Spain has already come out to warn it will agree to the new target but without having a plan to reach it. The communique reads: \"United in the face of profound security threats and challenges, in particular the long term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security and the persistent threat of terrorism, allies commit to invest 5% of GDP annually on core defence requirements as well as defence-and security-related spending by 2035.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:38 Is the UK preparing for war? It is a significant rise, that is broken down into 3.5% of GDP on core defence - up from a previous goal of 2% - and a further 1.5% to be invested in national resilience, such as roads, railways, energy and cyber security. The final communique was much shorter than usual, comprising just five paragraphs. In the only mention of Russia's war in Ukraine, it said: \"Allies reaffirm their enduring sovereign commitments to provide support to Ukraine, whose security contributes to ours, and, to this end, will include direct contributions towards Ukraine's defence and its defence industry when calculating allies' defence spending.\" Mr Trump has vowed to end Russia's war in Ukraine but has so far failed to stop the fighting.

Emissions should be falling, but are still rising.

Pic: AP Why you can trust Sky News Global sea levels are now rising twice as fast as they did last century, according to a major new scientific report. The study - which takes a laser focus on climate change in the 2020s, a critical decade to stop the worst damage - finds all 10 measures are going in the wrong direction. And most of them are doing so at a faster rate. The findings are \"unprecedented\" but \"unsurprising\", given the world continues to pump record levels of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. \"We see a clear and consistent picture that things are getting worse,\" said lead author Professor Piers Forster. However, the rate by which emissions are increasing has slowed down, offering a ray of hope they will soon reach their peak. Image: Global average temperatures have risen alongside levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere Rising seas The new study found sea levels are now rising on average twice as fast, at 4.3mm a year on average since 2019, up from 1.8mm a year at the turn of the 20th century. The acceleration is stark, but within the realms of what scientists expected. That's because the warming atmosphere has sent more melting ice flowing into the sea, and the ocean water expands as it warms. For the island nation of the UK, which risks coastal flooding, cliff falls and damage to homes and buildings, with 100,000 properties expected to be threatened with coastal erosion in England within 50 years. Dr Aimee Slangen, from the NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, said: \"The concerning part is that we know that sea-level rise in response to climate change is relatively slow, which means that we have already locked in further increases in the coming years and decades.\" A UK government spokesperson said: \"We owe it to future generations to tackle the climate crisis, by becoming a clean energy superpower.\" They are also spending Â£7.9bn on flood defences to \"strengthen our resilience\" and protect thousands of \"homes, small businesses, and vital infrastructure from this growing threat\". Image: Coastal erosion threatens UK coastal properties, including those at the top of this cliff near Sidmouth. Pic: PA Image: In England 100,000 properties are expected to be threatened by coastal erosion in 50 years' time. Pic: PA Meanwhile, the amount of greenhouse gases the world can still emit while limiting warming to safer levels has plummeted by 74% - from 500 billion tonnes of Co2 to 130bn. That leaves just three years' worth of emissions in the budget if the world is to limit warming to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels - the threshold widely agreed to be the best chance of avoiding very severe impacts. The report, involving more than 60 scientists, also warned the world is warming faster than ever before, by an \"unprecedented\" rate of 0.27C per decade.

Professor Forster later told Sky News: \"There is little good news across the entire indicator set.\" \"This is why I don't have my normal optimism.\" He added: \"Greenhouse gas emissions needed to have started dropping significantly in 2024 if we were to keep a chance of keeping long-term warming below 1.5C. \"The world has failed to do this.\" Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Change is possible Scientists urged leaders to draw up more ambitious national climate plans before the COP30 climate summit in Brazil in November. \"In a rapidly changing climate, evidence-based decision-making benefits from up-to-date and timely information,\" said the study, Indicators of Global Climate Change 2024, published today in Earth System Science Data. Dr ValÃ©rie Masson-Delmotte, from Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, said: \"What happens next depends on the choices which will be made: it is possible, by sharply reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to limit the magnitude of future warming, and protect young generations from the intensification of extreme events.\" Related Topics Climate Change Sky News footer YouTube Facebook X TikTok Instagram LinkedIn WhatsApp About Sky News About Us Sky News Profiles Sky News International Sky News Library Sales Site Map Editorial Guidelines Sky News Board Sky News Services Sky News RSS Sky News For Your Phone Sky News Radio Sky Channels Sky Witness Sky Atlantic Sky Arts Sky Cinema Sky Sports More Sky Sites NOW Sky Zero Sky Academy Studios Bigger Picture Sky Group Sky Bet Sky.com Sky News Arabia Advertise With Us Terms &amp; Conditions Privacy &amp; Cookies Privacy Options Accessibility Contact Us Â© 2025 Sky UK",

The tests began on Sunday in Austin, Texas, and it's the first time Tesla cars without a human driver have carried paying passengers. Musk sees the concept as a major part of the company's financial future and envisages thousands of the cars operating across the US. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Tuesday it was looking into the apparent errors. \"NHTSA is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,\" the agency said. One video shows a Tesla in a left turn-only lane going straight through an intersection , with the steering wheel shaking erratically, before it briefly veers in the wrong lane. Another clip shows a robotaxi brake hard several times in the middle of the road, apparently responding to the flashing lights of parked police cars.

The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) warned that around 99% of the population in the UK are breathing \"toxic air\". The report says there is \"no safe level\" of air pollutants while noting how exposure to air pollution can shorten life by 1.8 years on average. That is \"just behind some of the leading causes of death and disease worldwide\", including cancer and smoking, the authors wrote. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free The college has called on the government to take action to tackle the issue, as it urged ministers to \"recognise air pollution as a key public health issue\". In the forward of the report, England's chief medical officer, Professor Sir Chris Whitty, said: \"Air pollution remains the most important environmental threat to health, with impacts throughout the life course. \"It is an area of health where the UK has made substantial progress in the last three decades with concentrations of many of the main pollutants falling rapidly, but it remains a major cause of chronic ill health as well as premature mortality.

Faye Brown Political reporter @fayebrownSky Wednesday 18 June 2025 22:36, UK Image: File pic: iStock Why you can trust Sky News Sharing deepfake pornography is \"the next sexual violence epidemic\" facing schools, the author of a book on the spread of online misogyny has told MPs. Appearing before the Women and Equalities Committee (WEC), Laura Bates said there needs to be statutory guidance for teachers on how to deal with this \"very significant issue\". She said in every UK case she has investigated, schools have \"paid thousands of pounds hiring PR firms to focus on damage reputation management\". However, in terms of supporting girls and taking action against the perpetrators, \"nothing has happened\". She said of deepfake pornography: \"It is happening, it's significant. Female teachers are affected, which often goes unnoticed, and schools are just not equipped to tackle it. \"My suggestion would be this is the next big sexual violence epidemic facing schools and people don't even know it is going on.\" Deepfakes are pictures, videos or audio clips made with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to look or sound real. While it is illegal to create or share a sexually explicit image of a child, including a deepfake, the technology for making them remains legal. Image: Laura Bates before the Women and Equalities Committee Asked what more could be done to help schools tackle the issue, Ms Bates said in the cases she is aware of \"police investigations are ongoing\" . However, she said she is not suggesting criminalisation of underage boys is the solution and what is needed is education, prevention and regulation. \"It shouldn't be the case that a 12-year-old boy can easily and freely access tools to create these forms of content in the first place,\" she said. Ms Bates is the founder of the Everyday Sexism project and author of: The New Age of Sexism: How the AI Revolution is Reinventing Misogyny. She also called for \"very clear guidance\" on how schools should respond to this challenge. She warned of a repeat of failings that have happened previously with intimate image abuse, where girls have been \"coerced into sending images of themselves\" then punished for taking the image once it has been shared around - but the person spreading the image has not. Calls to ban 'nudifying apps' A government spokesperson told Sky News: \"We are reviewing the relationships, sex and health curriculum to look at all modern-day challenges facing children, including that of deepfake porn, and work to ensure children are taught how to build positive, healthy relationships in an age-appropriate way.\" It comes amid mounting concern among MPs and experts about online safety for children , with many wanting the government to go further with its regulations on big tech firms. Read More: Ofcom sets out new codes of practice to protect children online Can Adolescence change the rise of the 'manosphere'? In April, a report by the Children's Commissioner for England found that nudifying apps are disproportionately targeting girls and young women, with many appearing to work only on female bodies. The commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, called for an immediate ban on apps that use AI to create naked images of children, saying \"there is no positive reason for these to exist\". Inquiry into the 'manosphere' Ms Bates appeared in front of the WEC as part of their inquiry into how the \"manosphere\" and other online content is fuelling misogyny. The cross-party group has previously heard how the rise of misogyny in young men in particular is not only affecting female pupils but also female staff, with sexual harassment towards teachers described as \"rife\". On Wednesday's session, the committee also heard concerns around the rise of the \"sex tech industry\", including robots and AI girlfriends, with fears this is having a wider impact on attitudes towards women and girls.

Analysts tracked two pieces of malware spread by what appears to be Russian gangs on the code-sharing site GitHub, , according to cybersecurity firm Check Point. Its researchers said: \"The malware is developed by a Russian-speaking threat actor and contains several artefacts written in the Russian language.\" Thousands of Minecraft users have already been tricked into using the malware, which is designed to steal from bank accounts, cryptocurrency wallets, browsers and other computer applications. Graeme Stewart, head of public sector at Check Point, said it was similar to the way \"gangs operate to take down retail... they create this and then they flood it out to people and people then use it\". He described them as \"modern-day bank heist guys\". \"They're just in it for the money,\" he said. \"They're scraping these details from Minecraft to get into people's crypto wallets, trying to steal bank details, trying to commit bank fraud.\" The hacking software is hidden within the code of Minecraft modifications, which are pieces of code that allow users to change the game. Minecraft allows users to modify the game as they play - players can do anything from fixing bugs to changing how the game looks. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:27 Retail disruption to 'last months' But when players download the malicious code and place it into their Minecraft application, they don't get the ability to create \"funny maps\" or modify the game as promised. Instead, the next time they load Minecraft, the malware will trigger, and soon, \"it will start actively stealing data\", according to Mr Stewart. \"Most people have got their cards saved onto their browser and things like that, it'll start stealing that, names, addresses, emails, bank details, anything. \"If anyone's got a crypto wallet that they use through the browser, then it'll steal that as well.\" \"It's like a digital verruca, it buries itself into the machine and then starts sucking the information out,\" said Mr Stewart. Of the 200 million people thought to play Minecraft every month, around one million modify the game, and a lot of the code they use to do that is posted on GitHub. According to Ofcom, around 1.7 million gamers play Minecraft in the UK. A Minecraft spokesperson told Sky News that player safety is a \"top priority for us\" and the company is \"committed to investigating reported security violations\". \"When we receive reports of content that does not comply with our usage guidelines, we take action as appropriate,\" they said. \"We encourage players to report any suspicious content through our official website and leverage our resources to make informed choices.\" Hackers are increasingly targeting gamers in this way, with the UK's National Cyber Security Centre warning families to stay alert to dangerous downloads like this. \"There were some of us who thought it was only a matter of time before this particular vulnerability starts getting exposed en masse,\" said Dr Harjinder Lallie, a cyberattack academic at the University of Warwick. \"That's where we're going now.\" Although children may fall prey to this kind of attack, the group Dr Lallie and his colleagues worry about more are \"young adults who have admin [rights] on their own computer\". \"They're just a bit more savvy. They really want that mod; they want those extra features. And if it means [they] have to turn off the Microsoft Defender system for two minutes while [they] install it, then [they'll] turn it off, install that mod, and then turn it back on afterwards.

Pic: iStock Why you can trust Sky News Endangered rays, sharks and native oysters could thrive in seas around the UK in the decades ahead amid changing conditions in the oceans - but other common species could become rare, according to a study. Researchers looked at 19 threatened marine species in UK seas and the impact they could face from climate change. The results suggested an \"overall increase\" in suitable habitat for the study's selected species, although said any projected change for many was \"relatively small\". Some species will \"move or shift\" to new areas in response to rising ocean temperatures and this will have an impact on how they are managed and protected, the study added. Many species are anticipated to lose habitat with climate change, researchers said. Maintaining or increasing the numbers of vulnerable animals around the UK might require additional management methods. Projecting habitat changes into the future has \"a number of uncertainties\" and species may find \"favourable\" new areas, but the conditions could then \"move\" to zones which are \"not suitable\" for species to survive. The report, published in the Marine Biology journal, said although rays, sharks and oysters could become less threatened - there were risks for other species. \"Spurdog, thornback and undulate rays and native oyster showed the largest increases in suitable habitat this century, whereas decreases were seen in the slender sea pen, ocean quahog, sea fan and fan mussel,\" said the report. \"The increases were concentrated in the central and northern North Sea and the decreases to the south and west of the UK, as well as in the southern North Sea.\" Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Some species may thrive in new areas not currently protected from human disturbance, scientists said.

Thursday 19 June 2025 11:31, UK Image: A field cycling imaging (FCI) scanner. Pic: The University of Aberdeen Why you can trust Sky News A \"pioneering\" new scanner derived from MRI technology could be used to track brain cancer spread and lead to improved treatment for patients, scientists have said. Researchers at the University of Aberdeen and NHS Grampian have been awarded Â£350,000 funding by the Scottish government to generate never-before-seen images of glioblastoma brain tumours. It is hoped the technology will improve treatment and quality of life for patients by investigating a new way to scan the tumours. Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of brain tumour with more than 3,000 new patients in the UK diagnosed each year. The University of Aberdeen said half of all patients die within 15 months of diagnosis even after extensive surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Field cycling imaging (FCI) is a new and specialist type of low-field MRI scan pioneered in Aberdeen and has already been found to be effective in detecting tumours in breast tissue and brain damage in stroke patients. It is hoped it can now be used to help brain tumour patients. Full body MRI scanners were invented at the Scottish university 50 years ago, but the FCI scanner is the only one of its type used on patients anywhere in the world. The FCI derives from MRI but can work at low and ultra-low magnetic fields, which means it is capable of seeing how organs are affected by diseases in ways that were previously not possible. It can also vary the strength of the magnetic field during the patient's scan - acting like multiple scanners and extracting more information about the tissues. The tech can detect tumours without having to inject dye into the body, which can be associated with kidney damage and allergic reactions in some patients. Those involved in the project will scan glioblastoma patients undergoing chemotherapy after surgery and chemoradiotherapy. It is hoped the research will establish that, unlike conventional MRI scans, FCI can tell the difference between tumour growth and progression, and \"pseudo-progression\" which looks like tumour but is not cancerous tissue, which could improve care and quality of life.

Professor Anne Kiltie, who is leading the study, said: \"If we can detect true tumour progression early, we can swap the patient to a potentially more beneficial type of chemotherapy. \"Also, being able to verify that a patient has pseudo-progression will prevent effective chemotherapy being stopped too early, because it was thought that the tumour has progressed, thus worsening prognosis. \"Providing certainty will also reduce anxiety for both patients and relatives and improve the quality of life of patients. \"Importantly, having a reliable method to identify progressive disease will allow development and more precise evaluation of emerging potential treatments. This is of particular importance as patients currently have a limited choice of treatments for combating their cancer. \"Ultimately, this study and related future work will improve quality, effectiveness and healthcare cost-effectiveness in the treatment of glioblastoma patients across Scotland and beyond.\" Related Topics Aberdeen Health Scotland Sky News footer YouTube Facebook X TikTok Instagram LinkedIn WhatsApp About Sky News About Us Sky News Profiles Sky News International Sky News Library Sales Site Map Editorial Guidelines Sky News Board Sky News Services Sky News RSS Sky News For Your Phone Sky News Radio Sky Channels Sky Witness Sky Atlantic Sky Arts Sky Cinema Sky Sports More Sky Sites NOW Sky Zero Sky Academy Studios Bigger Picture Sky Group Sky Bet Sky.com Sky News Arabia Advertise With Us Terms &amp; Conditions Privacy &amp; Cookies Privacy Options Accessibility Contact Us Â© 2025 Sky UK",

Mark Stone US correspondent @Stone_SkyNews Wednesday 25 June 2025 06:53, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:23 Timeline of Israel-Iran conflict so far Why you can trust Sky News There is a critical question hanging over the events of the past few days. Behind the chest-thumping from Donald Trump, and the bewilderment beyond at his statecraft-by-social-media, doubts have now reached fever pitch about the success of the American bombing of Iran's nuclear sites. Leaks from the US Defence Department suggest the bunker busting bombs dropped on Iran's three nuclear enrichment sites might only have set the country's nuclear capabilities back by months. Image: Pic: Reuters \"We were assuming that the damage was going to be much more significant than this assessment is finding,\" said one of three sources, speaking to NBC News. \"This assessment is already finding that these core pieces are still intact. That's a bad sign for the overall programme.\" NBC News has spoken to three sources - all of whom say that the initial assessment by the Defence Intelligence Agency has concluded that the US airstrikes were not as effective as Mr Trump claimed. Similar leaks were made to The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN. Follow latest developments in our live blog Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:04 Why did Trump lash out at Iran and Israel? Responding to the CNN leak, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"This alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as 'top secret' but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\" She added: \"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear programme. Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14 30,000lb bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\" In his address to the nation on Saturday night, Mr Trump had said: \"I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:34 Trump: Iran strikes 'spectacular success' US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has also dismissed the leaks, saying: \"Based on everything we have seen - and I've seen it all - our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. \"Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target - and worked perfectly. \"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran, so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the president and the successful mission.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:03 Iran's nuclear capabilities Battle Damage Assessments (BDAs) take a long time to be close to conclusive and require extensive intelligence analysis. Speaking to Sky News, former director of the CIA and top US General David Petraeus cautioned about drawing any conclusions at this stage. \"Well, the truth is, it is just too soon. And those who are leaking should know that it takes a long time to do the battle damage assessment. And those who have actually pushed back in very conclusive ways also probably should have wait for the full results,\" Gen Petraeus said. \"This is a very painstaking process. It's an effort by the overall intelligence community, not just Defence Intelligence Agency. In fact, the CIA would be the lead in this effort to mine all sources of intelligence, imagery, intelligence of all types, signals, cyber, even open-source intelligence.\" Read more analysis: There's one F word Trump fears most Can Tehran regard Trump as trusted broker of peace? --> Spreaker This content is provided by Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Pic: Cheshire Police A jury at Chester Crown Court heard how he gained his victims' trust by putting forward an \"outward facade of a glamorous and luxurious lifestyle\". On Tuesday, the second day of his trial, the defendant pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud. Prosecutor Matthew Kerruish-Jones told the jury that Watkin \"engendered trust and led a number of individuals to loan him large sums of money on the promise of either a financial return or luxury items\". \"Neither of which materialised,\" he said. He added: \"The defendant would make excuses and avoid the complainants, all the while spending large sums of money on maintaining his seemingly lavish lifestyle.\" Image: A Celine handbag purchased by Watkin. Pic: Cheshire police Image: Watkin's Dolce &amp; Gabbana trainers. Pic: Cheshire Police Watkin was said to have told victims their money would be used to buy Hermes handbags, which were then to be sold on for a profit. The jury was told bag purchases from Hermes were only allowed to select registered customers and, because of their exclusivity, the bags often attracted a value far in excess of their original price when resold. Watkin's victims included friend Hannah Jakes, who he admitted defrauding of Â£98,500, and Christine Colbert, owner of Dress Cheshire, who was defrauded of Â£43,800. He also defrauded his father, Jason Watkin, of Â£24,500. Andor Farkas, a barman at Harrods, was victim of a Â£14,000 fraud and had believed Watkin, a regular customer, was a millionaire, the court heard. Watkin also admitted fraud of more than Â£13,000 on James Irlam, who was told by Watkin he had a personal relationship with the director of Hermes and was able to source handbags. He also pleaded guilty to the Â£840 fraud of Naheem Akhtar, who the court heard had given Watkin the money for a pair of Lora Piana shoes which he never received.

Beth Rigby Political editor @BethRigby Wednesday 25 June 2025 03:10, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:38 Is the UK preparing for war? Why you can trust Sky News Welfare versus warfare: this is the week when tensions between the government's spending priorities are playing out in front of our very eyes. The prime minister, arriving in The Hague on Tuesday for the NATO summit, announced that the UK was set to increase spending on defence, security and resilience to 5% of GDP in the next decade to meet an \"era of radical uncertainty\" . This is a big spending commitment, and one that has yet to be funded. PM denies he's facing a confidence vote - read latest Carl Emmerson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the increase, in Tuesday's terms, would be like adding approximately Â£30bn to the 2027 target of spending around Â£75bn on core defence. But if you wanted the government to hammer home the need for warfare spending, read this from the new national security strategy, published on Tuesday: \"For the first time in many years, we have to actively prepare for the possibility of the UK homeland coming under direct threat, potentially in a wartime scenario.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:05 What is NATO's 5% defence spending goal? When I asked him about the threat, the PM told me the UK was \"facing daily challenges on the home front\", be that cybersecurity attacks on energy security as \"energy is weaponised by our adversaries\". His foremost duty as PM, as he has told me time and again, is the security of his citizens. But he is struggling to take his base with him and is facing a significant political challenge on the home front, as the tensions between funding warfare and cutting welfare come into view. For while the PM stressed on Tuesday that the planned Â£5bn of welfare cuts the government is planning to push through is not to pay for defence spending (the increased budget, so far, has come from overseas development aid or the capital investment budget); he is clear-eyed, too, that the welfare bill is unsustainable and must be dealt with. This is about choices, and the prime minister is making his - in the face of opposition from his MPs and voters, too. Get Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow This is perhaps going to be one of the hardest fights of his premiership to date. A third of his backbenchers have signed an amendment to next week's welfare vote that could see his welfare reforms killed off. Take a moment to take that in: the prime minister, but a year from an election landslide, is eyeing the prospect of a parliamentary defeat. That is some mean feat when you have a working majority of 165 votes. I don't need to tell you that defeat on a major policy area less than a year into government would be a serious blow for the prime minister. When I put it to him that he was facing an \"effective confidence vote in your leadership\", he rejected that. He told me: \"It's not a confidence vote. It's a vote. It's a vote about reform. It's about a vote about reform of our welfare system. It isn't working.

The progressive thing to do is to fix it so that it works for working people.\" Senior insiders tell me that they need to face down the rebellion, rather than watering down the bill. There is a financial reason for that - the government needs to find the savings in its attempts to stick to the chancellor's fiscal rules and its economic plan. There is also a political reason: having U-turned on winter fuel payments , Sir Keir can't do that again. So, roll in the massive whipping operation to try to whittle back this rebellion. Image: Sir Keir Starmer watches a demonstration by troops as he visits a marines training base in the Netherlands. Pic: AP I think there will be another argument that comes into view too in the coming months, and that will come back to warfare versus welfare because this is about a national conversation about how we spend public money. There are a couple of generations after me who have only ever lived in a peaceful world, who cannot remember, as I do, the Cold War or the moment the Berlin Wall came down. There are millions of Britons who for decades have taken the peace dividend of the post-Cold War period as governments cut back on defence spending and poured money into health, education and welfare instead. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Sir Keir has a big argument in the coming days with his party about welfare cuts that so many of his MPs think are unfair. But he will have a bigger argument still with the public for the need to sacrifice spending on some public services in order to fund defence. At a time when people are still struggling with the cost of living and are dissatisfied with public services, that's a really difficult argument to make. But this prime minister, eyeing a Russian aggressor, has made his choice.

Deborah Haynes Security and Defence Editor @haynesdeborah Wednesday 25 June 2025 13:16, UK Image: The UK will buy at least 12 of the F-35 fighter jets. File pic: PA Why you can trust Sky News The UK will buy at least 12 F-35 stealth jets that can carry nuclear warheads in the most significant strengthening of its nuclear capability in a generation, the government has said. Sir Keir Starmer told a summit of NATO allies in The Hague that the new squadron will join an alliance mission that can be armed with US nuclear weapons. The dramatic move will doubtless draw condemnation and concern from Russia and China. But it comes at a time of growing global insecurity - and as the prime minister and his European and Canadian counterparts scramble to convince Donald Trump they are serious about bolstering their ability to defend Europe, instead of overly relying on the US. The US president, a long-standing NATO sceptic, raised questions about whether he would uphold the alliance's founding Article 5 principle - that an attack on one is an attack on all - before he even arrived in the Dutch city last night. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:36 'There's numerous definitions of Article 5' An urgent need to keep Mr Trump on side has prompted NATO allies to agree to increase spending on defence and national resilience to a new target of 5% of GDP by 2035. As part of this push to rearm, Sir Keir will give the Royal Air Force the ability to carry airborne nuclear warheads for the first time since the 1990s. \"In an era of radical uncertainty we can no longer take peace for granted,\" he said. \"These F-35 dual capable aircraft will herald a new era for our world-leading Royal Air Force and deter hostile threats that threaten the UK and our allies. \"The UK's commitment to NATO is unquestionable, as is the alliance's contribution to keeping the UK safe and secure, but we must all step up to protect the Euro-Atlantic area for generations to come.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:05 What is NATO's 5% defence spending goal? It was not immediately clear when the F-35 jets would be bought or how much they will cost, but the new squadron will be part of a NATO-led nuclear deterrence mission. That is in contrast to the UK's national nuclear deterrence, based on a fleet of four nuclear-armed submarines, though they too are used to defend the whole of the alliance. Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, applauded the plan - saying: \"The UK has declared its nuclear deterrent to NATO for many decades, â€‹and I strongly welcome today's announcement that the UK will now also join NATO's nuclear mission and procure the F-35A. \"This is yet another robust British contribution to NATO.\" Image: Sir Keir meets troops as he visits a marines training base in Rotterdam. Pic: AP Aircraft operated by a small number of NATO countries, including Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, are cleared to carry US-provided nuclear weapons in a war. The RAF and the Royal Navy already operate F-35B jets that can fly off Britain's two aircraft carriers, but they are not equipped to drop nuclear warheads. The new planes will be the F-35A variant, operated by the air force, that take off from land but can fly further and be armed with nuclear or conventional weapons. The government said they would all be based together at RAF Marham in Norfolk. --> Spotify This content is provided by Spotify , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

The decision to purchase 12 of the A-variant does not mean extra aircraft. It just means a diversification in the fleet - something the RAF has long been pushing for - though it's a decision some in the Royal Navy have long pushed back against, believing it would reduce even further the number of the B-version that operate from their carriers.

The government described the plan to purchase nuclear-capable aircraft as the \"biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation\". Asked at the NATO summit what the F-35s will give us that we didn't have before, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"They give us a diversity of capability and a capability that we didn't have before and that is really important.\" Defence Secretary John Healey said a major defence review published earlier in the month highlighted new nuclear risks. \"It recommended a new UK role in our collective defence and deterrence through a NATO-first approach,\" he said. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free However, the public version of the Strategic Defence Review stopped short of making any specific recommendation. It merely said \"the UK must explore how to support the US and its NATO allies in strengthening extended deterrence across the Euro-Atlantic\". Lord George Robertson, the lead author of the review, in fact signalled a lack of enthusiasm in such a move. \"Yes, we considered it,\" he told MPs. \"The fact that it's not there indicates that we weren't terribly enthusiastic about it. When I was defence secretary the last time round, I got rid of the free-fall bombs.\" Lord Robertson was defence secretary between 1997 and 1999. Pressed by the Defence Select Committee earlier this month on whether the concept had been ruled out entirely, Lord Robertson added: \"We said it should be the subject of further discussion. We didn't rule it out.\" The F-35 aircraft is made by the US defence giant Lockheed Martin, but the British defence company BAE Systems is also a key contributor. The order will support 20,000 jobs in the F-35 programme in the UK.

But when asked if Russia could attack within months, Mr Zelenskyy said he did not \"believe [Putin] is ready\".

On his dealings with Donald Trump, Mr Zelenskyy avoided any criticism and focused instead on how the US president interacts with Mr Putin, calling them \"short-term partners\" but not friends. Zelenskyy appeared defiant - but he's struggling to make himself heard Mark Austin Chief presenter He's an embattled wartime leader struggling to make himself heard. For Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy the war in Iran could not have come at a worse time. Suddenly the world's attention is on a different conflict and most crucially so is the attention of the most powerful man in the world, Donald Trump. But this is a big 24 hours for Zelenskyy, a meeting with Sir Keir Starmer in Downing Street followed by the NATO summit in The Hague. When I sat down with President Zelenskyy in the last few hours he had two main issues on his mind. Firstly, the proposed spending pledge by NATO countries of 5% of GDP by 2035 - that he said was too slow and warned that Putin would be ready with a new army within five years. Read more from Mark here On the topic of a potential ceasefire and peace talks, Mr Zelenskyy was clear he supported both, adding that he would enter negotiations to understand \"if real compromises are possible and if there is a real way to end the war\". But he avoided saying whether he would be willing to surrender land to Russia as part of any peace deal, instead suggesting military force and sanctions would force Mr Putin into negotiations. The Ukrainian leader also spoke about the failure of international sanctions. He said Russia was still able to access \"components for missiles and drones\" from countries, including the UK. The UK and its NATO allies will formally sign off the defence spending plans when the heads of state and government meet in The Hague on Tuesday and Wednesday. The spending goal is broken down into 3.5% of GDP to be spent on pure defence and 1.5% of GDP on related areas, such as infrastructure and cybersecurity. Defence spending of 5% is the kind of level invested by NATO allies during the Cold War.

Katie Spencer Arts and entertainment correspondent Saturday 21 June 2025 05:36, UK Image: An artist's impression of what Secret Cinema's Grease experience will look like when it opens in August Why you can trust Sky News While cinemas are struggling and London's West End has witnessed a significant escalation in ticket prices, creatives behind immersive experiences say their sector is experiencing \"a gold rush moment\". From shows built around obvious fan bases - such as Mamma Mia! The Party - to those working with established intellectual property, including Squid Game: The Experience, the UK has proven to be a world leader when it comes shows that make audiences feel part of the action, rather than just observers. Little Lion Entertainment are the team behind two shows currently running in the UK: Pac-Man Live in Manchester and the Crystal Maze Live in London. Its CEO Tom Lionetti told Sky News: \"There has been a real boom in the experience economyâ€¦ It kind of feels like a bit of a gold rush moment in this industry. \"It's not nascent anymore, it really is a big industry and it's getting bigger. \"West End theatre is incredibly expensive at the moment and even cinema can be expensive for what it is, so I think it's about caring about the experience â€¦ you've got to consider value for money these days.\" Their Crystal Maze show challenges ticketholders to climb through tunnels and collect crystals just like contestants on the '90s programme.

Despite times being financially tough post-pandemic, while cinemas have been struggling to put bums on seats, the continued popularity of experience events could indicate consumers are being a little more choosy about what they spend their hard-earned wages on. Image: Participants get the full experience - minus the hit show's host Our eagerness to show off on social media could also account for some of what's driving the boom, as well as the isolating nature of how technology-dependant we've become. As Secret Cinema's senior creative director, Matt Costain, explains: \"Whether it's competitive socialising or immersive experiences, people are look for something that offers them moreâ€¦ and this is an example of an activity where people can come together and have a sense of community.\" Secret Cinema - which combines live performance and film screenings - has been staging events for 15 years now. In that time, they've partnered with major studios from Marvel to Netflix. Their latest offering will run from August see them bring Grease's Rydell High to life. Image: Secret Cinema is recreating locations from the classic film Costain says: \"When we first started this was niche, film fans who wanted to dress up and keep a secretâ€¦ but immersive has moved mainstream and we've found ourselves one of two or three companies who've been in it since the beginning. \"Part of our job as artists is to help people remember that they really love to play.\" Image: Grease: The Immersive Movie Musical will feature Stephanie Costi as Sandy, Liam Buckland as Kenickie and Lucy Penrose as Rizzo He jokes that those \"who find it the most difficult to get started\" are invariably the ones \"at 11pm with their tie tied around their head and dancing on a table\". While there are many shows working with established intellectual property (IP), there are also some hugely creative original works also being produced - Storehouse being one of those. For 16 weeks, attendees at Staged in Deptford, which was once the archival store for Rupert Murdoch's News International, will be guided through a story that takes place inside a 'digital memory palace' that supposedly houses every story, message, memory, and meme since the dawn of the internet.

The proposed legislation, to be presented in Parliament today, comes as part of efforts to tackle prison overcrowding . Currently, foreign inmates with no right to stay in the UK are sent back to their home country after serving half of their sentence. But under the plans, they will instead be removed after just 30% of their term. Image: Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood hopes the measures will free up space. Pic: PA The measure would apply to those given determinate sentences - fixed maximum terms in prison that offenders do not necessarily serve all of behind bars. It would not apply to those convicted of terrorism or terror-related offences. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) estimates that, combined with other upcoming reforms, some foreign prisoners would end up serving only 10% of their sentence in England and Wales, down from about 20 to 25% currently. The law is also being tweaked so they can be deported 48 months before the end of their custodial sentence, rather than 18 months before. The changes will free up an estimated 500 cells per year, with around 12% of the prison population currently made up of foreign offenders, according to the government.

Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"With prisons close to bursting, I'm clear we shouldn't be giving bed and board to foreign criminals with no right to be here. \"These changes will get more of them on planes out of the country much sooner, saving taxpayers' money and keeping our streets safe as part of our Plan for Change. \"This government's message is crystal clear - if you come here and break our laws, you'll be sent packing in record time.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:16 May: Inside Preston prison The proposals follow calls from the Conservatives for a change in the law to give the government the power to deport all foreign criminals. The MoJ said the measure would be a discretionary power, meaning that some prisoners may be refused permission to be deported in certain circumstances, such as if there was clear evidence they were planning further crime. The government hopes the shake-up will come into effect in September, if it is approved in Parliament.

Tuesday 24 June 2025 11:03, UK Image: An artist's impression of the new bridge to be built in St James's Park. Pic: PA/Cabinet Office Why you can trust Sky News An architect who once criticised the King has won the bid to design a memorial in honour of his late mother Queen Elizabeth II. Lord Norman Foster will oversee the replacement of the current bridge in St James's Park with a \"very light touch\" glass one, inspired by the tiara the Queen wore on her wedding day. Image: The translucent bridge is inspired by the late Queen's wedding tiara. Pic: PA He will also transform the wider park with a statue of the Queen in a new space called Queen Elizabeth II Place at Marlborough Gate, a new Prince Philip Gate on the other side at Birdcage Walk, complete with a statue of the late Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen together, and a \"family of gardens\" around the new bridge. Lord Foster, known for designing The Gherkin, accused King Charles of using his \"privileged position\" to intervene in the plans for the former Chelsea Barracks in 2009. The then Prince of Wales, a fan of more traditional architecture, allegedly wrote to the Qatari developers requesting more classical plans be considered over those submitted by Lord Foster. But in an interview with on Monday, the architect said the pair are now \"totally aligned\". He insisted his previous \"minor differences\" with the King were in the past and \"absolutely insignificant\" as part of the bigger picture. Image: An impression of the new gardens planned for St James's Park. Pic: PA/Cabinet Office Bridge to reflect Queen's 'unifying nature' The translucent \"unity\" bridge will represent the late monarch's ability to bring nations, communities, and the Commonwealth together. \"The Queen encompassed, historically, periods of significant change, socially and technologically, but it was all very much with a light touch, and that light touch, the feeling should be that if you visit St James's Park and the site in question later, it will still feel very familiar,\" Lord Foster told the Press Association. It will be wider than the current stone bridge, allowing more visitors to enjoy the surrounding gardens, he added. \"It will feel better. It won't be so crowded, although this number of people will be going through it, and the experience will be heightened, but it won't be 'Oh, my god, they've destroyed the tradition of this park'.\" Described by the designer as \"jewel-like\", the bridge's cast-glass balustrades will be inspired by the Queen Mary Fringe diamond tiara the then Princess Elizabeth wore on her wedding day to Prince Philip in 1947. Image: An impression of visitors on the new bridge. Pic: PA/Cabinet Office The antique metal frame famously snapped as she was getting ready that morning and had to be rushed to the jewellers Garrard to be fixed before the ceremony. It was of great sentimental value to the Queen, who loaned it to her granddaughter Princess Beatrice to wear on her wedding day in 2020. Lord Foster plans for the bridge to be illuminated at night and be floated down the River Thames before being installed seamlessly overnight - without the need for heavy building work.

Pic: PA/Cabinet Office The overall plans for the bridge, statues and gardens reflect the late monarch's \"formal and informal\" sides, he said. Lord Foster, who was appointed to the Order of Merit by the Queen in 1997 for his services to architecture, said: \"Like many, I knew the Queen through formal occasions, but there was this very special relationship between Her Majesty and those of us who were members of the Order of Merit. \"So we were privileged to see perhaps a more informal aspect of Her Majesty and in many ways that is mirrored in our design. \"It is in some ways formal in its relationship to The Mall and informal in the gardens, and the perhaps breaking down those barriers in terms of narrative storytelling.\" Image: Plans for the statue memorial to Queen Elizabeth II.

Pic: PA/Cabinet Office The Queen's former private secretary Lord Janvrin, chairman of the Queen Elizabeth Memorial Committee responsible for awarding the commission for the bridge, hailed the design's \"sensitivity\". He suggested the Queen would have particularly liked the representation of her tiara. \"Her Majesty would undoubtedly have liked the location and I think she would have picked up that echo of the tiara in the bridge,\" Lord Janvrin said. \"I think the planting would have been of huge interest to her and the contrast between formal and informal - and the Commonwealth area would have resonated with her.\" Image: Another view of the statue memorial to Queen Elizabeth II. Pic: PA/Cabinet Office He said it was fitting that someone who knew the Queen had been chosen to design the national memorial to her. \"She knew him personally and made him a member of the Order of Merit, which is a personal gift way back in the late 1990s,\" he said. \"So, in a way, I think the fact that he has been this hugely important figure during her reign is deeply appropriate to end up with this extraordinarily important assignment at this stage.\" He added that it \"wouldn't have surprised him\" if the King had already seen the design. The final plan will be unveiled in 2026 - the late Queen's 100th birthday year. Next, a sculptor will be appointed for the two statues. There are also plans for potential audio installations of the Queen's voice. Foster + Partners won the competition after being selected by the memorial committee from five shortlisted designs , with feedback taken from a public vote, as well as stakeholders and cultural experts. The winning team also includes artist Yinka Shonibare, ecologist Professor Nigel Dunnett, who was behind the Superbloom planting scheme in the Tower of London's moat to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee, and landscape architect Michel Desvigne Paysagiste.

Tamara Cohen Political correspondent @tamcohen Wednesday 18 June 2025 21:12, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:40 Government's battle over welfare reforms Why you can trust Sky News Liz Kendall, the welfare secretary, said today that the welfare system was at a crossroads - and that the road she had chosen was the one of \"compassion, opportunity and dignity\". Dozens of Labour MPs feel that what was promised as a plan to support disabled people into work has instead turned into a cost-cutting exercise to shave Â£5bn off the budget. Politics Live: US may ask UK to station refuelling aircraft at key British base Kendall announced the reforms in March, saying that the welfare bill was \"spiralling\" and \"unsustainable\". The figures are striking: nine million working-age people are economically inactive. Personal Independence Payment (PIP) claims per month have doubled in just five years. Many MPs agree the system needs reform, but worry the government is acting without fully thinking through the consequences. Today saw the legislation published - the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill - setting out a tightening of criteria for the main disability benefit in England, PIP. It also sets out plans to cut the health element of Universal Credit and delay access to it until age 22. Forty-two Labour MPs have signed a letter saying they cannot support the changes - and the names include newly-elected MPs who have not been critical of the government before. They say concessions, such as a longer grace period before benefits are removed, are not good enough. Image: Liz Kendall .Pic: PA Cat Eccles, MP for Stourbridge, who spoke to Sky News today, has been on sickness benefits herself - after an unexpected illness saw her forced out of her job. She said she was worried about people who rely on PIP for the costs of working â€“ such as petrol, and those who would lose it, but not be ready for employment. \"It's really not good enough because we know so many people this is going to affect,\" she said. \"We know PIP can be a gateway to getting other benefits like carers allowance which really help families just survive. We're not even talking about people having some great lifestyle, they're literally barely surviving on these payments. It all just doesn't feel very Labour to me.\" Other MPs who have not yet spoken publicly are concerned. \"It seems as if we're getting all the bad stuff first â€“ before we hear about the job schemes and child poverty strategy\", one said.

Government insiders believe the rebellion can be contained. But it poses a challenge, and both Ms Kendall and Stephen Timms have been devoting time to one-on-one meetings to win around individual MPs. PIP â€“ paid at a basic rate of Â£73.90 a week at the standard rate, and Â£110.40 at the enhanced rate â€“ would be restricted from people who do not score four points on the daily living criteria.

She currently qualifies for the enhanced rate, but fears she would not meet the new criteria and lose Â£440 a month if reassessed when these changes take effect next year. \"People are terrified, we're angry, that yet again we're the scapegoat, we had it with the conservatives for 14 years\", she told Sky News. \"I use it to help pay for my carer's expenses because I pay her, I use it for petrol for the car so I can get out and about, and obviously extra winter fuel; the increase in bills since April has been astronomical.

Deborah Haynes Security and Defence Editor @haynesdeborah Wednesday 25 June 2025 13:16, UK Image: The UK will buy at least 12 of the F-35 fighter jets. File pic: PA Why you can trust Sky News The UK will buy at least 12 F-35 stealth jets that can carry nuclear warheads in the most significant strengthening of its nuclear capability in a generation, the government has said. Sir Keir Starmer told a summit of NATO allies in The Hague that the new squadron will join an alliance mission that can be armed with US nuclear weapons. The dramatic move will doubtless draw condemnation and concern from Russia and China. But it comes at a time of growing global insecurity - and as the prime minister and his European and Canadian counterparts scramble to convince Donald Trump they are serious about bolstering their ability to defend Europe, instead of overly relying on the US. The US president, a long-standing NATO sceptic, raised questions about whether he would uphold the alliance's founding Article 5 principle - that an attack on one is an attack on all - before he even arrived in the Dutch city last night. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0:36 'There's numerous definitions of Article 5' An urgent need to keep Mr Trump on side has prompted NATO allies to agree to increase spending on defence and national resilience to a new target of 5% of GDP by 2035. As part of this push to rearm, Sir Keir will give the Royal Air Force the ability to carry airborne nuclear warheads for the first time since the 1990s. \"In an era of radical uncertainty we can no longer take peace for granted,\" he said. \"These F-35 dual capable aircraft will herald a new era for our world-leading Royal Air Force and deter hostile threats that threaten the UK and our allies. \"The UK's commitment to NATO is unquestionable, as is the alliance's contribution to keeping the UK safe and secure, but we must all step up to protect the Euro-Atlantic area for generations to come.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:05 What is NATO's 5% defence spending goal? It was not immediately clear when the F-35 jets would be bought or how much they will cost, but the new squadron will be part of a NATO-led nuclear deterrence mission. That is in contrast to the UK's national nuclear deterrence, based on a fleet of four nuclear-armed submarines, though they too are used to defend the whole of the alliance. Mark Rutte, the head of NATO, applauded the plan - saying: \"The UK has declared its nuclear deterrent to NATO for many decades, â€‹and I strongly welcome today's announcement that the UK will now also join NATO's nuclear mission and procure the F-35A. \"This is yet another robust British contribution to NATO.\" Image: Sir Keir meets troops as he visits a marines training base in Rotterdam.

The RAF and the Royal Navy already operate F-35B jets that can fly off Britain's two aircraft carriers, but they are not equipped to drop nuclear warheads. The new planes will be the F-35A variant, operated by the air force, that take off from land but can fly further and be armed with nuclear or conventional weapons. The government said they would all be based together at RAF Marham in Norfolk. --> Spotify This content is provided by Spotify , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

The decision to purchase 12 of the A-variant does not mean extra aircraft. It just means a diversification in the fleet - something the RAF has long been pushing for - though it's a decision some in the Royal Navy have long pushed back against, believing it would reduce even further the number of the B-version that operate from their carriers.

Asked at the NATO summit what the F-35s will give us that we didn't have before, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"They give us a diversity of capability and a capability that we didn't have before and that is really important.\" Defence Secretary John Healey said a major defence review published earlier in the month highlighted new nuclear risks. \"It recommended a new UK role in our collective defence and deterrence through a NATO-first approach,\" he said.

It merely said \"the UK must explore how to support the US and its NATO allies in strengthening extended deterrence across the Euro-Atlantic\". Lord George Robertson, the lead author of the review, in fact signalled a lack of enthusiasm in such a move. \"Yes, we considered it,\" he told MPs. \"The fact that it's not there indicates that we weren't terribly enthusiastic about it. When I was defence secretary the last time round, I got rid of the free-fall bombs.\" Lord Robertson was defence secretary between 1997 and 1999. Pressed by the Defence Select Committee earlier this month on whether the concept had been ruled out entirely, Lord Robertson added: \"We said it should be the subject of further discussion. We didn't rule it out.\" The F-35 aircraft is made by the US defence giant Lockheed Martin, but the British defence company BAE Systems is also a key contributor. The order will support 20,000 jobs in the F-35 programme in the UK.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has laid out potential remedies Google may have to make, including allowing people to easily switch search engines through a legal requirement for so-called \"choice screens\". Also being considered is ensuring people can transfer their browser history to another provider, and a requirement for transparency over search result ordering and inclusion in AI-generated summaries. Money blog: Warning issued over Glastonbury tickets The CMA has also proposed designating the tech giant with \"strategic market status\", which would give the regulator greater control over how Google operates search services. Why is this happening? It's all being done to give consumers \"more choice and control\" and to unlock \"greater opportunities for innovation across the UK tech sector and broader economy\", the CMA's chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said. The average person in the UK makes five to 10 searches a day, the CMA said, with Google's services \"critical\" for more than 200,000 UK businesses, which rely on the company to reach customers. \"Our investigation so far suggests there are ways to make these markets more open, competitive and innovative,\" Ms Cardell said.

Possible measures and concerns outlined by the watchdog do not mean Google is guilty of anti-competitive practices. Nor does the \"strategic market status\" designation, given due to its dominant position in search and advertising. Were the CMA to go through with the measures, \"the outcome could have significant implications for businesses and consumers in the UK\", Google's senior director for competition, Oliver Bethell, said. \"This announcement presents clear challenges to critical areas of our business in the UK.\" \"We're concerned that the scope of the CMA's considerations remains broad and unfocused, with a range of interventions being considered before any evidence has been provided,\" the firm added. The announcement on Tuesday morning is a continuation of the investigation first announced in January . What next? A final decision on whether to apply the remedies and designate Google as having \"strategic market status\" will be made in October. But in the second half of 2026, the CMA said it planned to consider actions to address \"more complex\" concerns.

The company has said teams from SNCF, France's state-owned railway company, are working hard to restore the damaged infrastructure and that one track had been reopened. \"This will allow trains to run in both directions until full repairs are completed, expected by around 4pm,\" Eurostar said. Money blog: Your Eurostar rights explained Its services were already disrupted because many trains and staff members were out of position after two fatalities on rail lines in France on Tuesday. At least five services on its London-Paris route were cancelled on Wednesday, and seven others were delayed by around an hour. Image: Passengers at St Pancras International station in London.

Affected passengers are able to change their travel plans free of charge, or request a full refund. Images show large crowds of stranded passengers at St Pancras International station in London today. In a post on X, Eurostar said the cable theft meant trains were likely to be \"subject to severe delays and last-minute cancellations\", adding: \"We advise you to cancel or postpone your trip.\" Eurostar passenger Elizabeth Romijn, 75, a yoga teacher from the Netherlands said she is used to issues with the train service, but described Wednesday's disruption as \"very chaotic\". She was planning to make her way home catching the train to Brussels today after visiting friends in Guildford, Sussex and has decided to wait in the station to see if she can board a train.

Mr Romijn said: \"My plan is to just wait. Maybe I should go and be more proactive and go to ask one of the staff but nobody seems to know anything. And it's quite horrible long queues. \"On the email they said, don't go, go cancel your travel or take a voucher or something - but I thought I'm going to travel anyway.

Eight men, aged between 20 and 31, and two 17-year-old boys were arrested at addresses in London and later charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and remanded in custody, the Metropolitan Police said. Staff at the shops were said to have been threatened by individuals who \"often had their faces covered and were sometimes armed with weapons\", police added. The robberies happened between February and early June and were part of a \"concerted effort to steal phones and sell them overseas\", detectives said. Thousands of pounds worth of new phones were taken from secure rooms at stores in what police described as \"similar incidents\".

Sky News' security and defence editor Deborah Haynes writes and presents the series, which imagines what would happen if Russia attacked the UK and tried to break up NATO in this new Trump-era world. Here are all the episodes, in one place. Episode one introduces the scenario and our experienced cast. Listen to False Flag below: In episode two, The Wargame escalates - with the UK finding itself under attack. Episode three chronicles how the UK responds, as well as its efforts to get allies to help. And in the latest episode, there's a chilling ultimatum... And in the final episode, a choice is made... 14:17:02 The big names tested in The Wargame The scenario presented in The Wargame is designed to test Britain's defences and national resilience at a time of mounting tensions with Russia. It also explores the reliability - or otherwise - of key allies like the United States in a crisis. A top team of former government ministers and military and security chiefs took part in the podcast, which was written and presented by security and defence editor Deborah Haynes . Here's a list of the key cast members: Sir Ben Wallace , a former Conservative defence secretary, plays the prime minister; Jack Straw , a former senior Labour politician, resumes his old job as foreign secretary; Amber Rudd steps back into her former role as home secretary; Jim Murphy , Scottish secretary under Gordon Brown, takes the position of chancellor; James Heappey , a former armed forces minister, plays the defence secretary; Lord Mark Sedwill is the national security adviser - a position he held for real under both Theresa May and Boris Johnson; General Sir Richard Barrons , one of the leaders of a recently published major defence review, plays the role of chief of the defence staff, the UK's top military officer; Baroness Helena Kennedy , a barrister and expert on human rights law, appears as attorney general; and... Lieutenant General Sir David Capewell resumes his former role as chief of joint operations, the UK's warfighting commander. 14:16:55 What if Russia attacked the UK?

How can Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer recover the numbers and avoid a political humiliation? The government's working majority is 165, so it only takes 83 Labour MPs to vote with a united opposition and this bill is dead - and along with it, a lot of this government's political and moral credibility.

Pic: Reuters Why you can trust Sky News Police in Australia are offering a $500,000 (Â£238,670) reward for information leading to the discovery of the remains of murdered British backpacker Peter Falconio. The reward has been announced ahead of the 24th anniversary of the 28-year-old's death. Mr Falconio and his partner Joanne Lees, both from Yorkshire, had been driving near the tiny settlement of Barrow Creek on the remote Stuart Highway in the Northern Territory of Australia in 2001. The couple were backpacking across the country in a camper van when Bradley John Murdoch pulled up beside them claiming to have seen sparks coming from their vehicle. He shot Mr Falconio in the head as he inspected the van, before forcing Ms Lees into his vehicle and binding her wrists with cable ties. She managed a daring escape, hiding in the outback scrub for hours before flagging down a passing truck. During the trial, prosecutors argued that Murdoch had likely disposed of the backpacker's body somewhere in the vast, remote expanse of desert between Alice Springs and Broome, covering more than 1,200 miles. Despite repeated searches, Mr Falconio's body has never been found. Murdoch was convicted in 2005 and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for at least 28 years for the murder of Mr Falconio and the attack on his girlfriend. He has always maintained his innocence and has never revealed the location of Mr Falconio's body. Image: Bradley John Murdoch was convicted of Peter Falconio's murder in 2005. Pic: Darwin Police Department Mark Grieve, acting Northern Territory Police commander, said officers \"still hold out hope\" someone may hold \"vital information\" to aid in the search. \"In what will be the 24th anniversary of (Falconio's) death this July, being next month, we're asking for anyone who may believe they have information that can assist to please come forward and contact police,\" he told reporters in Darwin. \"It's never too late to reach out, and at least start that conversation with police, because you just never know how beneficial that information that you may hold may be. \"We recognise the passage of time that's transpired, however, it's never too late to reach out and start that conversation with police.\" Read more: Police deny Falconio's remains have been found New appeal in hunt for backpacker Peter Falconio's body Follow The World Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim every Wednesday Tap to follow Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Murdoch, 67, was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer in 2019 and was moved to palliative care from Alice Springs Correctional Centre earlier this month, according to local media reports.

He was not eligible for parole until 2033, but would have remained behind bars under \"no body, no parole\" laws preventing him from being released if he refused to disclose Mr Falconio's whereabouts.

His primary message was to try to reassure the public that the UK government was working to stabilise the region as best it could and press for a return to diplomacy. But what struck me in our short interview was not what he did say but what he didn't - what he couldn't - say about the US strikes. It was clear from his swerve on the question of whether the UK supported the strikes that the prime minister neither wanted to endorse US strikes nor overtly criticise President Donald Trump. Follow latest: Trump hails 'bullseye' strikes on Iran Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:00 Starmer reacts to US strikes on Iran Instead, his was a form of words - repeated later in a joint statement of the E3 (the UK, Germany and France) - to acknowledge the US strikes and reiterate where they can agree: the need to prevent Iran having a nuclear weapon. He also didn't want to engage in the very obvious observation that President Trump simply isn't listening to Sir Keir Starmer or other allies, who had been very publicly pressing for de-escalation all week, from the G7 summit in Canada to this weekend as European countries convened talks in Geneva with Iran. Image: Donald Trump and Sir Keir Starmer at the G7 in Canada last week. Pic: Reuters It was only five days ago that the prime minister told me he didn't think a US attack was imminent, when I asked him what was going on following President Trump's abrupt decision to quit the G7 early and convene his security council at the White House. When I asked him if he felt foolish or frustrated that Trump had done that and didn't seem to be listening, he told me it was a \"fast moving situation\" with a \"huge amount of discussions in the days since the G7\" and said he was intensely pressing his consistent position of de-escalation. What else really could he say? He has calculated that criticising Trump goes against UK interests and has no other option but to press for a diplomatic solution and work with other leaders to achieve that aim. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:15 What is Operation 'Midnight Hammer'? Before these strikes, Tehran was clear it would not enter negotiations until Israel stopped firing missiles into Iran - something Israel is still saying it is not prepared to do. The US has been briefing that one of the reasons it took action was because it did not think the Iranians were taking the talks convened by the Europeans in Geneva seriously enough. It is hard now to see how these strikes will not serve but to deepen the conflict in the Middle East and the mood in government is bleak. Iran will probably conclude that continuing to strike only Israel in light of the US attacks - the first airstrikes ever by the US on Iran - is a response that will make the regime seem weak.

If Iran chose to attack the US via proxies, then UK bases and assets could be under threat. The prime minister was at pains to stress on Sunday that the UK had not been involved in these strikes. --> Spreaker This content is provided by Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

By Sky News Data and Forensics Unit Wednesday 25 June 2025 11:08, UK Why you can trust Sky News Israel and Iran exchanged aerial bombardments after Israel's surprise attack in the early hours of 13 June - before both countries announced on Tuesday they had agreed to a ceasefire. Thousands of missiles have been sent by each side, and the US also supported Israel in using bombers to strike Iran's main nuclear sites. This map shows the strikes in Iran, broken down by the type of attack. You can zoom in and click on individual points to see more detail, or click on parts of the key to focus in on specific types of targets. We will be keeping these maps updated each day, with the latest developments in the conflict. And here's a close-up on the capital Tehran. The close proximity of key targets there means it has been the most heavily hit part of the country. Israel's sophisticated air defence system - consisting of the Iron Dome, David's Sling, Arrow System and American-made Patriot System, each of which respond to different sorts of missile, rocket and drone attacks - mean that most of the attacks on the country have been intercepted without causing any damage. Nonetheless, Iran struck several targets in Israel, including many in and around Tel Aviv. America joined in the attacks on Iran on 22 June (or 21 June US time), using B2 bombers to drop several Massive Ordnance Penetrator \"bunker busters\" on Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities. The bombs are about as long as a transit van, and weigh about as much as a standard five-door car. They were thought to be the only weapons on the planet capable of penetrating the Iranian sites which were buried deep underground. Image: A GBU-57 or Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb. File pic: US Air Force/AP Donald Trump said the attacks had \"completely and totally obliterated\" the facilities. These satellite images show the impact of the attacks. Image: Satellite imagery of Fordow after the US bombing. Credit: Maxar However, leaks from the US Defence Department suggest the bunker busting bombs dropped on Iran's three nuclear enrichment sites might only have set the country's nuclear capabilities back by months. \"This is a very well-developed, long-standing programme with a lot of latent expertise in the country,\" said Darya Dolzikova, a proliferation and nuclear security expert at RUSI, a UK defence and security thinktank. \"I don't think we're talking about a full elimination at this point, certainly not by military means.\" The ceasefire agreed between Israel and Iran on the morning of 24 June appears to be holding for now, despite a shaky start.

Wednesday 25 June 2025 05:42, UK Image: Pic: iStock Why you can trust Sky News Injured dog walkers could be costing the NHS about Â£23m a year, a study suggests. Hand and wrist injuries from a yanked lead are said to be the most common mishap. Experts from Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and Singapore's Sengkang Hospital looked at the \"understudied topic\" by reviewing five US studies of almost 500,000 dog-walking injuries. Women made up three-quarters of the injuries, and 31% of the cases were in over-65s. Researchers - writing in the journal Injury Prevention - found that broken fingers were the most common injury. Looking at the UK's population of about 8.5 million dogs - one for every seven or eight people - the study estimated the cost of fixing the fractures suffered by unfortunate owners. \"While finger fractures were the most frequently reported injury, the cost analysis in this review focused on distal radius [wrist] fractures due to their substantial economic impact,\" said researchers.

Mark Stone US correspondent @Stone_SkyNews Wednesday 25 June 2025 06:53, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:23 Timeline of Israel-Iran conflict so far Why you can trust Sky News There is a critical question hanging over the events of the past few days. Behind the chest-thumping from Donald Trump, and the bewilderment beyond at his statecraft-by-social-media, doubts have now reached fever pitch about the success of the American bombing of Iran's nuclear sites. Leaks from the US Defence Department suggest the bunker busting bombs dropped on Iran's three nuclear enrichment sites might only have set the country's nuclear capabilities back by months. Image: Pic: Reuters \"We were assuming that the damage was going to be much more significant than this assessment is finding,\" said one of three sources, speaking to NBC News. \"This assessment is already finding that these core pieces are still intact. That's a bad sign for the overall programme.\" NBC News has spoken to three sources - all of whom say that the initial assessment by the Defence Intelligence Agency has concluded that the US airstrikes were not as effective as Mr Trump claimed. Similar leaks were made to The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN. Follow latest developments in our live blog Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 4:04 Why did Trump lash out at Iran and Israel? Responding to the CNN leak, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"This alleged assessment is flat-out wrong and was classified as 'top secret' but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.\" She added: \"The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear programme. Everyone knows what happens when you drop 14 30,000lb bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration.\" In his address to the nation on Saturday night, Mr Trump had said: \"I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:34 Trump: Iran strikes 'spectacular success' US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has also dismissed the leaks, saying: \"Based on everything we have seen - and I've seen it all - our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. \"Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target - and worked perfectly. \"The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran, so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the president and the successful mission.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:03 Iran's nuclear capabilities Battle Damage Assessments (BDAs) take a long time to be close to conclusive and require extensive intelligence analysis. Speaking to Sky News, former director of the CIA and top US General David Petraeus cautioned about drawing any conclusions at this stage. \"Well, the truth is, it is just too soon. And those who are leaking should know that it takes a long time to do the battle damage assessment. And those who have actually pushed back in very conclusive ways also probably should have wait for the full results,\" Gen Petraeus said. \"This is a very painstaking process. It's an effort by the overall intelligence community, not just Defence Intelligence Agency. In fact, the CIA would be the lead in this effort to mine all sources of intelligence, imagery, intelligence of all types, signals, cyber, even open-source intelligence.\" Read more analysis: There's one F word Trump fears most Can Tehran regard Trump as trusted broker of peace? --> Spreaker This content is provided by Spreaker , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

By Sam Coates, deputy political editor, and Joe Cook, political producer Tuesday 24 June 2025 11:23, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 2:04 Do you want AI listening in on chats with your doctor? Why you can trust Sky News Doctors are using AI software that does not meet minimum standards to record and transcribe patient meetings, according to a Sky News investigation. NHS bosses have demanded GPs and hospitals stop using artificial intelligence software that could breach data protection rules and put patients at risk. A warning sent out by NHS England this month came just weeks after the same body wrote to doctors about the benefits of using AI for notetaking - to allow them more time to concentrate on patients - using software known as Ambient Voice Technology, or \"AVT\". Health Secretary Wes Streeting will next week put AI at the heart of the reform plan to save the NHS in the 10-year plan for the health service in England. But there is growing controversy around software that records, transcribes and summarises patient conversations using AI. In April, NHS England wrote to doctors to sell the benefits of AVT and set out minimum national standards. However, in a letter seen by Sky News, NHS bosses wrote to doctors to warn that unapproved software that breached minimum standards could harm patients.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:59 Is ChatGPT reliable despite its 'hallucinations'? NHS England sets minimum standards but does not tell NHS trusts and healthcare providers which software providers to use. Sky News can now reveal there is growing pressure on NHS England and similar bodies to be more proactive. Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: \"Undoubtedly, as a GP myself and my 35,000 colleagues, we've got responsibilities here - but in such a rapidly developing market when we haven't got the technical knowledge to look into this. \"We need that help and support from those who can check that the products are safe, check they're secure, that they're suitable for use in the consulting room, and NHS England should do that and help and support us.\" Dr Wrigley continued: \"We're absolutely in favour of tech and in favour of taking that forward to help NHS patients, help my colleagues in their surgeries. \"But it's got to be done in a safe and secure way because otherwise we could have a free for all - and then data could be lost, it could be leaking out, and that just isn't acceptable. \"So we are not dinosaurs, we're very pro-AI, but it has to be a safe, secure way.\" Image: The head of the NHS Confederation says the letter is 'a really significant moment' The spectre of dozens of little-known but ambitious AI companies lobbying hospitals and surgeries to get their listening products installed worries some healthcare professionals. There are huge profits to be made in this technological arms race, but the question being asked is whether hundreds of different NHS organisations can really be expected to sift out the sharks. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the letter was \"a really significant moment\". He said it was right for the NHS to experiment, but that it needed to be clearer what technology does and does not work safely.

Mr Streeting said: \"I've heard anecdotally down the pub, genuinely down the pub, that some clinicians are getting ahead of the game and are already using ambient AI to kind of record notes and things, even where their practice or their trust haven't yet caught up with them. \"Now, lots of issues there - not encouraging it - but it does tell me that contrary to this, 'Oh, people don't want to change, staff are very happy and they are really resistant to change', it's the opposite. People are crying out for this stuff.\" Read more from Sky News: National investigation launched into maternity services Every baby in the UK to receive DNA testing Image: GP Anil Mehta says AI software helps cut paperwork and patients are 'extremely reassured' Doctors who use AI that complies with national standards already say there are big benefits. Anil Mehta, a doctor in the health secretary's Ilford constituency, told Sky News he backed his MP's drive for more AI technology in healthcare. Dr Mehta demonstrated the version of Ambient Voice Technology that he uses. This software, Accurx Scribe, has been developed and deployed in line with all current NHS England requirements for AVT, and there is no suggestion this product breaches any rules, standards or guidance. Indeed, the company which developed it meets weekly with NHS England on creating a standardised approach to scale the benefits across the NHS. \"I spend 30% of my week doing paperwork,\" Dr Mehta said. \"So I think once I've explained all of those features of what we're doing, patients are extremely reassured. And I haven't faced anybody that's not wanted to have me do this. He added: \"(I) think that consultation with your doctor is extremely confidential, so that's not changed at all. \"That remains confidential - so whether it's a vulnerable adult, a vulnerable child, teenager, young child with a parent, I think the concept of that confidentiality remains.\" An NHS spokesperson said: \"Ambient Voice Technology has the potential to transform care and improve efficiency and in April, the NHS issued guidance to support its use in a safe and secure way. \"We are working with NHS organisations and suppliers to ensure that all Ambient Voice Technology products used across the health service continue to be compliant with NHS standards on clinical safety and data security.\" Related Topics Artificial Intelligence NHS Sky News footer YouTube Facebook X TikTok Instagram LinkedIn WhatsApp About Sky News About Us Sky News Profiles Sky News International Sky News Library Sales Site Map Editorial Guidelines Sky News Board Sky News Services Sky News RSS Sky News For Your Phone Sky News Radio Sky Channels Sky Witness Sky Atlantic Sky Arts Sky Cinema Sky Sports More Sky Sites NOW Sky Zero Sky Academy Studios Bigger Picture Sky Group Sky Bet Sky.com Sky News Arabia Advertise With Us Terms &amp; Conditions Privacy &amp; Cookies Privacy Options Accessibility Contact Us Â© 2025 Sky UK",

Former N-Sync star Justin Timberlake - a man who's crooned about his love of \"dance, dance, dance\" and has recently become a meme for his mic-centric moves on stage - is a headliner too. Image: Justin Timberlake - and his trusty mic stand. Pic: Reuters Meanwhile, Glastonbury Festival will see headline acts including Olivia Rodrigo, the 1975, and Charli XCX. But along with the headline stars and hot weather, politics has also found its way into the spotlight. Youth culture and political expression have long been part of the festival experience, with Vietnam, nuclear disarmament, Brexit and the Russian invasion of Ukraine all attracting attention over the decades. This year, with geopolitics seemingly at a boiling point, the Israel-Hamas war has had far-reaching implications. As the Israel-Iran war follows in its wake, the conflict has prompted strong opinions on both sides. Irish-language rap trio Kneecap 's upcoming Glastonbury Festival set has become a flashpoint for robust debate, drawing protests from those calling for their set to be cancelled, as well as those championing their right to speak out.

'If we think we're separate from world events, we're kidding ourselves' Faithless star Sister Bliss, who performed at the first of the re-instated Isle of Wight Festivals and is performing again this year, tells Sky News: \"If we think that we're separate from world events, we're absolutely kidding ourselves. Our lives are tied intrinsically to everybody else's on the planet. \"You can have certain people that express that in a way that is perhaps a tad crass, but I love that lyrically - especially on our records, in songs that we've made over the last 30 years - I feel that you can combine the personal and political in a way that's not tub-thumping or simplistic. These issues are very nuanced that are going on in the world right now .\" Image: Sister Bliss of Faithless. Pic: Callum Baker Speaking to Sky News at the Isle of Wight Festival, Clean Bandit star Grace Chatto says artists are right to use the stage to amplify their voice. \"It is such a great place for political speech, like when Jeremy Corbyn spoke at Glastonbury - it was the most attended thing of the whole event, and it just brought such a feeling of unity and hope in that field on that day\". The 39-year-old cellist adds: \"Then recently, Kneecap and Massive Attack have just been so important, I think, and amazing.\" Earlier this month, Massive Attack, who have previously been critical of Israel, included footage of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his family as part of a video montage at one of their concerts.

Pic: @photosbychloeh 'I've got loads of friends who are absolute idiots politically' Fresh from the Isle of Wight Main Stage, Mae Muller tells Sky News: \"With what's happening in Gaza, I know that's been a very prominent theme with people saying, 'Should we speak out about it or not?' But that's not political, it's a human rights issue. \"It's important for us to use our voice, because not everybody can. If we feel strongly about something, and we can stand behind it, I think [the stage is] definitely a place to do it.\" Image: Mae Muller. Pic: Sarah Louise Bennett Muller, who represented the UK at last year's Eurovision Song Competition - which became a highly politicised event despite the attempts of the organisers to keep it from the stage - continues: \"Art is inherently political, and you can't really escape it. And we shouldn't want to escape it. It can be two things at once. [Politics] and fun can coexist. \" Meanwhile, Razorlight front-man Johnny Borrell, ahead of his Main Stage performance, tells Sky News: \"Why not say what you believe in? Why does everyone get so precious? \"You can disagree with people. I've got loads of friends who are absolute idiots politically - they think the earth is flat.

That's what's changed recently.\" A 'disruptor' festival, showing the world that anything is possible' Regardless of the polarised times, Isle of Wight Festival promoter John Giddings, 72, says the Isle of Wight Festival experience should be a break from activism rather than a call to arms. The 72-year-old, who represents artists ranging from Blondie to Phil Collins, told Sky News: \"We're purely about music and entertainment, and we are to switch off from politics for three or four days. We're in the business of entertaining people, not preaching to people. And I don't understand why people attempt to. That's a different forum.\" Image: Isle of Wight Festival promotor, John Giddings. Pic: PA Giddings, who relaunched the iconic festival after it was outlawed by authorities in 1970, fearing the crowds and rowdy behaviour could detract from the island, may be keen to avoid political controversy, but he's keen to break the mould in other areas. Following a long line of stars before him, including Bob Dylon, Jimi Hendrix and Joni Mitchell , singer Emmanuel Kelly has become the first physically differently-abled artist to perform on the Isle of Wight Festival's Main Stage. The 31-year-old former X Factor star, who supported Coldplay on their Music Of The Spheres tour last year, says as far as accessibility is concerned, the Isle of Wight Festival is a trailblazer. Image: Emmanuel Kelly. Pic: James Millington Photography Kelly tells Sky News: \"Somebody that's different is on the stage and is able to show the world that anything's possible.\" Echoing the festival's early rebel roots, he credits it with being a \"disruptor\", adding, \"They make the extra effort to teach the others around the world to make the extra effort as wellâ€¦ It's important and it's happening and I'm excited for it.\" In response to Sir Keir's call for Kneecap to be removed from the line up at Glastonbury next weekend, and whether the performance would be available on any BBC platforms if it goes ahead, a BBC spokesperson said: \"As the broadcast partner, the BBC will be bringing audiences extensive music coverage from Glastonbury, with artists booked by the festival organisers. \"Whilst the BBC doesn't ban artists, our plans will ensure that our programming will meet our editorial guidelines. Decisions about our output will be made in the lead up to the festival.\" The Isle of Wight Festival runs until Sunday 22 June, with the Glastonbury Festival kicking off on 25 June.

Anjum Peerbacos Education reporter Wednesday 25 June 2025 02:57, UK Why you can trust Sky News There has been a sharp and sustained decline in the number of children and young people writing for pleasure, a new report has found. Only one in four children aged 8 to 18 say they enjoy writing in their free time - a dramatic fall in the rate, which has nearly halved over the last 15 years. The report points to an increasing disengagement from writing, with worrying consequences for literacy, learning outcomes, and children's wider development. The levels of enjoyment are falling fastest among those aged 8 to 11, with girls seeing the greatest drop since COVID. \"Writing has slipped to the bottom of the rankings in national academic performance, falling below even mathematics,\" says the National Literacy Trust in a report on National Writing Day. The findings highlight the critical role writing for pleasure plays in children's academic and personal growth.

In today's digital-first society, the ability to write clearly, thoughtfully, and critically is more vital than ever. Jonathan Douglas, chief executive of the National Literacy Trust said: \"If children are to get the most out of what AI can offer with the ability to add their own thoughts and check outputs, empowering young people with the writing skills they need is critical.\" \"Young people who write with confidence are better equipped to engage with AI-generated content, to question it, and to make it their own,\" the Trust added.

Primary school teacher Lee Parkinson agreed with the report's findings, saying: \"At primary, the idea of writing for pleasure has just really been lost. \"The problem that we've had as primary school teachers is that the curriculum is just so packed, and so full on, that you don't have a space in it for anything.\" \"There's just too much to cover, not enough time and you're just constantly bouncing from one subject to the next. And there's just, you don't really seem to have the opportunity to get depth with anything, not just writing - just anything.\" His secondary school colleague Gaurav Dubay, a director of English, added: \"Writing for pleasure and writing for length generally seems to be on the decline. There isn't much room on the curriculum for extended creative writing, including fictional and transactional pieces. \"However, there is a growing consensus that this needs to change.\" Read more: More Britons than ever struggling to make ends meet UK to buy F-35 jets that can carry nuclear warheads Foreign prisoners to be deported earlier under plans Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 9:36 'We want to work with schools' Children eligible for free school meals are more likely to enjoy writing in their free time than their peers (31.1% versus 25%), the report found.

It added that NHS leaders have spent months cutting \"wasteful\" spending, such as on \"back office\" functions and agency staff, while reducing forecast deficits by health trusts. GP funding will be reviewed under the new plan, as surgeries serving working-class areas receive an average of 10% less funding per patient than practices in more affluent areas. Practices in some of England's poorest areas have about 300 more patients per GP than the most affluent areas, data by the Royal College of GPs suggests.

Amazon owner Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez have a star-studded guest list for their three-day Venice wedding celebrations, where they are expected to pack on to the billionaire's super yacht. But not everyone is excited. By Lauren Pinkney Wednesday 25 June 2025 10:45, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:00 Jeff Bezos is treating the city 'like his own private ballroom', one protester told Sky News Why you can trust Sky News Billionaire Jeff Bezos is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former TV journalist, in a glitzy multi-day event in Venice. While city officials haven't confirmed the wedding details, Italian media has reported that there are three days of celebrations planned from Thursday to Saturday, costing up to â‚¬48m (Â£41m). The main wedding party had reportedly been due to take place at the Scuola Grande della Misericordia on Saturday, but will now be held at the Arsenale, out of the city centre, according to Reuters news agency. The guest list includes the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio, Eva Longoria, Oprah Winfrey and Mick Jagger, as well as pop star Katy Perry, who joined Ms Sanchez in the all-female celebrity crew that travelled to space in April. They and other celebrity guests are set to join the couple for parties on the Amazon owner's super yacht, worth about $500m (Â£371m), which will dock in the port of Venice for the wedding, Sky TG24 in Italy reports. But not everyone in the city is excited. Image: Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos at Donald Trump's inauguration. Pic: Reuters Why are there protests?

Blue Origin rocket launch - as it happened: What Katy Perry sang in space and how all-female crew reacted to flight Related Topics: Jeff Bezos Venice Protesters do not have an issue with the marriage itself but with what they say is the \"privatisation\" and \"exploitation\" of the city. \"He is basically going to treat the whole city as a private ballroom, as a private event area, as if the citizens are not there,\" said Alice Bazzoli, an activist with No Space for Bezos. The group is a coalition of around a dozen Venetian organisations - including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups - and its name is a play on words also referring to the bride's recent space flight. Members of the group have told Sky News that the event will close parts of the city and make it difficult for locals to get around, as well as posing environmental concerns with the use of yachts in the canals. Image: No Space For Bezos protesters stand with an anti-Bezos banner at the San Giorgio Maggiore basilica. Pic: Federica Toninelli \"This is not what Venice needs. This is not what a city that is already suffering from overtourism needs,\" Federica Toninelli, another activist associated with No Space for Bezos, said. The city has long struggled with high tourism numbers. Millions come to see the World Heritage Site for its medieval architecture, crammed into a picturesque canal network. However, this pushes up the cost of living for locals and tends to create only low-paid temporary employment. \"It's going to bring money, yes, but we are not going to see any money,\" said Ms Toninelli. The protests are also linked to wider issues around affordable housing and a dwindling local population in Venice's historic centre. \"Do we want our city even more invaded by tourists, by oligarchs, and people who buy and privatise the city, or do we want services, jobs, health services, schools, universities? Do we want to live in the city like normal people, or sell it to the best offer?\" Ms Bazzoli added. Image: No Space For Bezos protesters gather in Venice. Pic: Federica Toninelli Activists from global environmental lobby Greenpeace and the UK group Everyone Hates Elon have joined the protests, with their focus on some of the wider issues raised by Bezos's critics around the world, such as purported tax breaks for him and fellow billionaires. Mr Bezos has been contacted for comment. What have protesters done so far - and what else are they planning? Members of No Space for Bezos unfurled a massive banner on 12 June from the bell tower of the San Giorgio Maggiore basilica with Bezos's name crossed out. Image: An anti-Bezos sign hung on the bell tower of the San Giorgio Maggiore basilica. Pic: Federica Toninelli Then on Monday activists from Greenpeace and Everyone Hates Elon unveiled a huge banner in St Mark's Square with an image of Mr Bezos laughing and the caption: \"If you can rent Venice for your wedding you can pay more tax.\" It appeared to be a nod to Amazon's ongoing tax disputes with European governments. Image: The banner placed in St Mark's Square by protesters. Pic: Reuters The local activists planned a more organised protest for Saturday, where they were aiming to stop guests from arriving at a party by blocking the canals with boats and their bodies. But the plans have been altered since the party was reportedly moved to Arsenale, a 14th-century complex surrounded by water and impossible to reach by land when bridges are raised. The protesters have claimed the venue change as a victory and said there will now be a march on Saturday instead of the blockade. What has the response been to the protests? The mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro, has said he is \"honoured\" that the city is hosting the event, adding: \"Once again Venice proves to be a world stage.\" \"Those 20 people who are putting up posters are clearly capitalising on [Jeff Bezos's] image,\" he went on. The city of Venice has previously denied that the event would disrupt locals, saying water taxi services would run normally and that only 200 guests had been invited. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding in numbers â‚¬48m price tag The wedding and its parts are expected to cost an eye-watering â‚¬40-48m (Â£34-Â£41m), Luca Zaia, the president of Venice's local government, said on Tuesday. This includes sizeable charity donations from the Amazon founder, including â‚¬1m (Â£850k) to Corila, a consortium that studies Venice's lagoon ecosystem, local media has reported. 90 private jets The first private jets began landing at Venice airport on Tuesday and there will be around 90 in total, Mr Zaia said. They won't all be arriving in Venice though, as some will land at the nearby Treviso and Verona airports. 250 guests Five of the city's most luxurious hotels have been booked out to host an estimated 200-250 guests. These include the celeb favourite Cipriani, where George and Amal Clooney married in 2014. 30 water taxis Attendees of course won't be hopping on public water buses to get around the city's many islands. The wedding's organisers have booked at least 30 water taxis for them to use instead. \"Venice is used to being the stage for events and shows every week, without significant impacts,\" a statement said, citing G20 and G7 summits, the Architecture and Cinema Biennales, as well as private events. It added that the city has previous experience of hosting big events successfully. A Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos' Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \"important donation\". What other events has the cited hosted? George and Amal Clooney famously got married there in 2014. The actor arrived at his ceremony at the Aman Grande Canal Hotel on a boat, alongside guests including Matt Damon and model Cindy Crawford. The city also hosted world leaders for the 2021 G20 summit, as well as its annual Venice Film Festival. Image: Day-trippers take a gondola tour in July 2024. Pic: Reuters How does Venice place limits on tourists? Venice has been struggling with the impacts of overtourism. There were about 50,000 people living in the historic city centre in 2023 - and about 4.9 million tourist arrivals - according to the data gathering website Statista. In 2024, it became the first city in the world to introduce a payment system for tourists, with officials carrying out random checks to make sure people beyond entry points have a QR code. As it stands, those visiting between April and July for a day trip pay a standard fee of â‚¬5, unless they have booked less than four days before their visit, in which case they must pay double. The city has also put in place a size limit of 25 people for tourist groups to reduce crowds. Where else have there been tourist protests? Venice isn't the only European city where locals are frustrated with tourist numbers. Protesters in Barcelona sprayed tourists with water guns as part of demonstrations recently over the number of visitors. Anti-tourism activists have also staged protests in other popular holiday destinations across Spain, including Palma, Malaga and the Canary Islands, claiming that visitors drive up housing costs and lead to residents being unable to afford to live in city centres.

But an analysis of the sites targeted by US and Israeli strikes on Iran suggests they may have been deliberately limited to avoid widespread radioactive contamination and the international condemnation that would almost certainly follow. The stated aim of the bombing raids was to eliminate the potential threat to Israel and the wider Middle East of a nuclear-armed Iran. --> Datawrapper This content is provided by Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

At least 10 sites associated with Iran's nuclear capability were apparently untouched. Some may have been spared because they weren't considered an imminent threat. Image: Satellite imagery of buildings at the Lashkar Ab'ad laser plant Facilities like the Lashkar Ab'ad nuclear enrichment plant. A decade ago it was involved in the faster, but technically challenging method of using lasers rather than centrifuges to enrich uranium. But Iran seems instead to have invested far more effort in using the slower, but more well-understood method that uses centrifuges to spin a gaseous form of uranium - uranium hexafluoride - to enrich it. Perhaps making Lashkar Ab'ad not worth the cost of an expensive bomb or missile. Image: Satellite imagery from 23rd June 2025 shows tunnel entrances at the Kolang Gaz La complex Then there's the Mt. Kolang Gaz La complex. Based on our assessment of the latest satellite images, the underground complex immediately adjacent to the Natanz nuclear facility also wasn't targeted. Perhaps because it is still under construction. However, once it is complete, and if, as most analysts assume, Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium escaped destruction in the raids, it would be a very good place to hide it. Read more: Israel-Iran latest updates The mountain of Kolang Gaz La is far higher than the one sheltering the recently attacked Fordow facility . If the tunnel complex being built beneath it is completed, it would be a far more challenging target for America's bunker-busting bombs. But other sites may well have been spared to avoid a national, potentially international, nuclear disaster. Nearly all the sites hit were involved with Uranium enrichment, like the centrifuge facilities at Natanz and Fordow. And while uranium is radioactive, targeting enrichment facilities doesn't pose the same radioactive risk as other processes. Uranium is very heavy. Even if hoisted into the air by a bomb - it quickly falls to the ground. Read more: How much damage has been done to Iran's nuclear facilities? \"If you were to expose uranium hexafluoride to the atmosphere, then it reacts with the water and the uranium drops out,\" said Prof Laurence Williams, former UK chief inspector of nuclear installations. Although it would be dangerous to anyone close - the other part of the reaction forms hydrofluoric acid which is incredibly toxic - the radioactive uranium would effectively stay close to where it started. Get Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow Nuclear reactors are a very different story. While operating, reactors contain a complex soup of radioactive elements. Some of these, like strontium, caesium and iodine are lightweight, or volatile, as well as highly radioactive. \"If they escape, then they're going to get into the atmosphere,\" said Prof Williams. \"If you've a force, like in the case of Chernobyl , where you had a fire which was elevating the volatiles, then they get into [the] atmosphere and then get distributed by normal atmospheric dispersion.\" In short, bombing a nuclear reactor would lead to potentially widespread nuclear contamination certainly nearby, and potentially beyond Iran's borders. For this reason, Israeli and US commanders may have deliberately avoided targeting them. Image: Strikes on Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre do not appear to have targeted the research reactor. Pic: Maxar At Isfahan for example, Israeli, and then American, raids destroyed multiple buildings linked to Uranium enrichment. But neither hit buildings that house small research reactors on the site. The same goes for the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant in the south of Iran , and the Tehran Nuclear Research Reactor located in the capital city. But reactors are important if Iran were to be pursuing a nuclear weapon. During operation, most designs produce plutonium as a by-product. Perfect for making nuclear bombs. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 1:23 Timeline of Israel-Iran conflict so far Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free And making plutonium in a reactor is much faster than enriching uranium using centrifuges. And this probably explains why Israel bombed Iran's Arak Heavy Water Reactor, which would have been capable of making 9kg of plutonium a year. The likely reason they did is because the reactor was in the process of being rebuilt and contained no fuel - and therefore there was no risk of nuclear disaster. Follow The World Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim every Wednesday All this goes to show these recent strikes may well have been a compromise. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned both Israel and America of the danger of targeting nuclear sites. While America and Israel may have wanted to wipe out Iran's nuclear ambitions, the risk of civilian casualties exposed to radioactive fallout from bombing and the international outcry that would create, left them pulling their punches.

The camera at the Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile is expected to reveal new details from space on an unprecedented scale as it makes further observations during the next decade. Scientists expect it to chart thousands of asteroids not previously identified - and believe it will discover within months whether there is a ninth planet in our solar system . The new images show the light from millions of stars and galaxies in observations which took the world's largest and most powerful camera only 10 hours to complete. One image shows a mosaic of the Trifid and Lagoon nebulae, a star-forming region which is 9,000 light years from Earth. A single light year is the distance light travels in 12 months.
